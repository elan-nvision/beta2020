<p>And they live happily ever after</p>
<p>Fairytales are enchanting !</p>
<p>Isn't it?</p>
<p>The abrupt encounter, greet and sudden meld after that.</p>
<p>Shh! but not a soul talks&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shh! but not a soul talks about the aftermath.</p>
<p>My merriment and I parted ways,</p>
<p>A broken speck came out with every "No", I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pulled, dragged, forced that night,</p>
<p>"You're my property and that's my right!"</p>
<p>The fist of timekeeper chocked me to death,</p>
<p>The barricade coming closer blocking each breath.</p>
<p>Tint of love, blessing and compromise.</p>
<p>Oops! Male dominance mastered all probable sides.</p>
<p>Screaming through the windows of my head</p>
<p>The only colour ignited that night was black and red.</p>
<p>I blazed the spirit,</p>
<p>Swallowed every drop,</p>
<p>Slashed my hand,</p>
<p>Did everything to stop.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That night I tasted my defeat</p>
<p>Pierced with lust and greed.</p>
<p>Horrified and gushed with blood, I stand to walk,</p>
<p>He dragged me towards my darker dark&nbsp;</p>
<p>To my darker dark.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I woke up with the demon beside,</p>
<p>Embracing the death of emotions I lied!</p>
<p>The colour of love turned to venom,</p>
<p>Dignity, pride, emotions all are numb.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I stood and walked towards my reflection</p>
<p>Terrified and shocked,</p>
<p>Touched my fizzog.</p>
<p>Sadly! the newly bloomed bride not lasted longer.</p>
<p>Smudged black lines,</p>
<p>Dulled lips,</p>
<p>Tangled hairs,</p>
<p>Eyes filled with fear.</p>
<p>I resisted my pearls to flow,</p>
<p>Walked to the people I know,</p>
<p>Familiar faces approached steadily and slow,</p>
<p>Smiled and declared, "hey! look at the glow."</p>
<p>No one cared.</p>
<p>No one shared.</p>
<p>No one faced the reality .</p>
<p>None dared.</p>
<p>The clock stuck at 10 for another start</p>
<p>He dragged me again to my darker dark.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Tonight I am free at last,</p>
<p>Penned down every single phase of my past.</p>
<p></p>
<p>His claws cannot pin me anymore,</p>
<p>His forced love cannot secure the door,</p>
<p>His clothes faded with just a snap,</p>
<p>His repented face turned into a scrap.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked at everything with closed eyes,</p>
<p>Wings got broken when I started to fly.</p>
<p>Lost myself in the verge of pain,</p>
<p>Regretted again with the decision I made.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Look around! and find your soul back,</p>
<p>Don't let anyone ,not even you&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drag you to your darker dark!!</p>
