<p>Nostalgia</p>
<p>I was going home in the bus after a tiring day,</p>
<p>More of a shitty day,</p>
<p>I plugged in the earphones and scrolled through spotify.</p>
<p>It was the kind of day, where I was too lazy to pick the song.</p>
<p>I played a song in the playlist you made,</p>
<p>Flying whales,</p>
<p>"Water of chaos, Have invaded all space",</p>
<p>I felt alive,</p>
<p>Soaking in the sun;</p>
<p>The air blowing my hair around,&nbsp;</p>
<p>A mischevious grin reached my eyes,</p>
<p>Everything felt beautiful,</p>
<p>Until the lollipop cut my tounge,</p>
<p>It left a sweet metallic taste,</p>
<p>It took me back to the time you left me,</p>
<p>I only had the dark metal playlist you made,</p>
<p>You named it buttercup with a cute red heart.</p>
<p>My bad, I kept forgetting back then too.</p>
<p>It's black metal not dark metal.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
