<p>During a 6-hour workshop, the professor asks me for a certin line of code. I misheard it and gave a very spontaneous reply as "4:30". The whole class burst into laughter as everyone, including the professor, thought I wanted him to leave early. I never looked him in the eye for the rest of the session.&nbsp;</p>
