<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">The book's title might be long, and the book is much longer with over 670 pages, yet it is something that everyone NEEDS to read. Almost everyone has read, watched or at least heard about Harry Potter (of course, it deserves all the attention) but no one knows about Harry Quebert and that's why I'm writing this to enlighten people and let them know what they're missing out by not reading this brilliant masterpiece. </span><br></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">Written by JoÃ«l Dicker, the book was originally published in French and later translated into 32 languages. It is also available as a web series.</span><br></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">It follows the story of Marcus Goldman, a successful novelist who suffers from writer's block. Marcus goes to seek inspiration from his professor Harry Quebert. When the body of 15-year-old Nola Kellergan is found 33 years after she went missing and Quebert is accused of her murder though Quebert claims to be innocent. Quebert also appears to be hiding something. What actually happened 33 years ago? Did Quebert actually murder the girl? If not, who had done it and why? Find out "The truth about Harry Quebert Affair" along with Marcus and prepare to get your mind blown a million times. </span><br></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">The book is written in such a simple, easy to understand manner. The narration is gripping, one can't stop reading the book until s/he is done with it. There are so many plot twists in it and the events happening in the story is unpredictable. The ending makes your eyeballs come out (not literally) and your life will never be the same. The truth unraveled at the end is something that you'd never be able to guess (I bet my whole life on this) and you would end up wanting to read the whole book again without knowing spoilers. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">My rating for the book:10/10 </span><br></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">So go get your hands on the book and start reading now!</span></p>
