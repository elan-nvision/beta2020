<p>&nbsp;The pleasure to<br>know time and then, My urge to be born and be born again&nbsp;</p>
<p>Loftier than a<br>thunder bliss is an ephemeral refuge of shadow kiss&nbsp;</p>
<p>A chance to<br>hear the call of sparrow calling out for<br>a willful tomorrow<br><br>A sweet poison so hard to contend, My urge to be born and be born again&nbsp;</p>
<p>You help me take<br>a leap of faith and land where formless Gods meditate<br><br>You help me drown in seas unknown, turn the vast wilderness into a home&nbsp;</p>
<p>A knowledge that<br>never goes in vain, my urge to be born and be born again&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gist of<br>life, a hunt for gold, a changeling vow and blessings untold&nbsp;</p>
<p>The debt of<br>Terra paid in kind, still inadequate for my wayward mind&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twenty six<br>thousand pole stars and abysmal plains, my urge to be born and be born again&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the city<br>gates call us inside, we play the game, you seek and I hide&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our hearts are<br>mirthful with promises kept; we thank the divinity for this concept&nbsp;</p>
<p>A powerful<br>enigma, who can comprehend? My urge to be born and be born again&nbsp;</p>
<p>So sweet a dream<br>the traveler saw, with winds awoke, left in awe&nbsp;</p>
<p>And waited for<br>the night to spread its wings to sleep underneath the bright auroraâ€™s dream&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;font-family: Times New Roman", serif;">But for each goodwill reign, A new form, a new<br>name, My urge to be born and be born again</span>&nbsp;</p>
