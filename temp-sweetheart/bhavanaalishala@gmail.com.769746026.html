<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(69,69,69);font-size: 17px;">It’s a terrible feeling knowing we aren’t together anymore. The countless times I’ve pulled out my phone to call you and have to stop myself. Innumerable sleepless nights reading back the online chats with had when we were still happy. I hated waiting for something that I feared wasn’t going to happen. And I hated myself even more for being right. That I didn’t walk away sooner. Instead, I kept giving you chances. Endless chances. Hoping things would change. Now, I have realized that you saved me more time and hurt knowing things were not going to change with you. As much as I love you and struggle with letting those feelings go, I let the urge to accept you are not mine anymore. I may not be completely over you and the wounds are still fresh. Change and moving on is what happens when the pain of holding on becomes more than the fear of letting go. And now it’s time for me to move on but you’ll always remain as my one and only love and I don’t mind telling it hella lot of times that ‘YOU ARE THE BEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME’</span></p>
