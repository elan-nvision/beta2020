<p><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong> Hey kiddo , </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong>Where do I even<br>begin ? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong>Okay , let<br>me start this with a happy news for you, I know you have just finished your<br>class 8</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> final exams and you are really apprehensive for the results.<br>Trust me boy, you have passed with flying colors, indeed you have topped the<br>class. (If you don’t really trust me , then wait for the results and then you<br>can come back and read this. </strong></span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI Emoji", sans-serif;"><strong>�</strong></span><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong>� ) </strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong>Now I am<br>gonna tilt towards the main motto for which I am writing this letter to you. By<br>how much I remember , currently you think you are the one who loves you the<br>most. Sorry ,but you are absolutely wrong, mummy and papa love you the most . I<br>wont force you to accept the fact, you yourself will realize it soon. Why am I telling<br>this to you ? BECAUSE you are really bad at spotting out people who truly love<br>you and who don’t . There are times coming ahead when people will actually love<br>you more than you love yourself . I just hope that, you return the same amount<br>of love to other person. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong>[a small<br>piece of random advice, mom and dad’s decision are not always right , but believe<br>me they just think the good for you when they make their decisions ,at least<br>consider their advice .] </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong>Coming back<br>, you are gonna be heart broken by many . You will cry yourself to sleep<br>everyday during that period of helplessness you will feel. That is just a part<br>of life, everyone passes through that stage. The sooner you understand life and<br>notice its beauty , the better . </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong>Too much<br>for you , sorry for that. Let me do a favor in the way I can , you get stomach<br>infection right before the first day of 9</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong> class, as you don’t want<br>to miss that, you go to school with that lose motion and you idiot poop in the<br>pant ! and people come to know about it …and then I guess you can imagine what<br>could have happened. I SAVED your ass! (oops, so apt. ) </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong>I don’t want<br>to tell you everything because I strictly believe that both sorrow and<br>happiness are parts of life, they both have their own place . Experience is<br>considered to be the best teacher in life .  </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong>Wanna know<br>where I am ? what I am doing ? why I am doing ? .Nah nah , I ain’t telling you<br>anything , you just give a think to all those points I have mentioned, then<br>look at yourself after 4 years . You will be somewhere in your life, currently I<br>am exactly at the opposite stage . I know you are mature enough to understand<br>what I am telling you ( excuse me  …… I know<br>I am mature enough*). </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong>I know my<br>style of writing sucks, clearly readable , happy -sad – happy- sad ……. I cant<br>help it dear , I actually want to sit a day with you and talk about many things<br>. But I am unable to express all those emotions in a single letter.  </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong>Finally ,I would<br>end this by saying I TRUST IN MYSELF.  </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong>I LOVE YOU 3000(btw Tony Stark dies, hahaha sorry.)  </strong></span></p>
