<p>Hey Adarsh,</p>
<p>Love meets us in most unpredicatble ways same as I  met you. Quite unexpected to what I thought it would be like, no first sight crush or an accidental slip in your arms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;But you know what it was better than all of it. Best of all I could think off. Slowly escalating to finest relations. Exasperating and exhilarating at the same tweaks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You redefined love to me. Not a fairytale but it was all those dreams in my eyes. Energies summit when our eyes lock, nerves race to eternity. You bring me serene annhilation.</p>
<p>Sun never promises to shine, but it always does and so do you. Your unsaid promises are faithfully fulfilled by you, each and every single day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are my happy place and if I would have to define love , it would be you. I need not say it, you know it all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS I LOVE YOU</p>
