<p><span style="color: rgb(95,91,91);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This review is going to be <strong><em>toit</em></strong>! Let's admit to the obvious fact out there, we've all been rooting for Jake and Amy right from the inane bet to goofy wedding! B99 is undoubtedly is the most hilarious show with a touch of romance and great content. Each episode begins with a 1 minute introduction scenes before the title track that are way funnier than the entire episodes at times. One can never forget the <strong><em>‘I want it that way</em></strong>’ by Suspects version. </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(95,91,91);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Jake Peralta is hands down, an amazing detective/genius. He’s goofy, quirky, immature and most of all likes to enjoy life to the fullest. We’ve all started to idolize John McClane along the way due to the influence of Jake and his numerous references to Die Hard. Also, let’s not forget the phase where Taylor Swift’s posters were hung all over our walls and Jake’s heart. We all know an Amy in our life or we are the Amy. She’s a proud bookworm and an over-achiever. Until Season 4, I always felt she was underrated for her skills and knowledge. Yet, in Season 5 she was truly recognized and had become a sergeant. Even by the end of Season 6, there was always a concerning question in our heads. Who is Rosa Diaz? She’s known as Emily Goldfinch to her neighbors, a badass cop, ballet dancer, holds a pilot license, attended business school and who knows what<br>else! Charles Boyle is the kind of best friend we all root for. He always goes to the extremes for his near and dear ones. His best friends’ list starts and ends with Jake Peralta. It was a tough phase for all of us to watch him move on from Rosa until he finally met Genevieve. The triumphs of Boyle’s family are endless. <strong><em>Gina knows best</em></strong>. She is the perfect example to cope up with the troubles around us by not giving a damn. She is practical and unapologetic. She is never afraid to speak her heartand her ideas are the ones that get precinct out of chaos. Holt is a stickler for rules. He subtly finds Amy to be annoying and secretly admits Jake to be his favorite. He has come a long way and has an even longer way to go. </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(95,91,91);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The series poses some of the major problems prevailing in the society. Although, they are not sugar-coated one has to have a deeper level of understanding to identify them. On the initial stages, Holt often tends to reminiscence what it was like to be a black cop back in the days. He<br>was often taken for granted and was never taken seriously by his peers. For Genevieve and Charles, adoption was their last option after they’ve exhausted every other option. Unfortunately, it is the same for most of the couples even in 20<sup>th</sup> century. </span> <span style="color: rgb(95,91,91);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Rosa had to face criticism from her parents when she confronted them of being bi-sexual. Although, in later episodes it is shown that her father comes around the idea but her mother wasn’t able to cope up with her daughter’s decisions. This highlights the crucial point where our society is still opposed to the concept of LGBTQ and considers them inferior to the rest. We’ve all loved and were always excited for the Halloween Heists every season. But with the plot twist<br>in Season 4, Gina reveals how she felt undermined as the heist always included detectives only. With their wit and spontaneity she wins the former <strong><em>Amazing Detective/ genius</em></strong>, now<strong><em> Ultimate human/genius</em></strong> title. This episode faintl reveals how our society is biased towards the rank of people. </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(95,91,91);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">For all the dog lovers out there, Cheddar must’ve been a treat to eyes. </span> <span style="color: rgb(95,91,91);background-color: white;font-size: 13.5pt;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">All in all,Brooklyn 99 is always <strong><em>noice</em></strong> to watch and the funniest show. Hoping the review is not biased, otherwise it’s all <strong><em>cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool!</em></strong></span><em> </em>&nbsp;</p>
