<p>Pain&nbsp;</p>
<p>i create an illusionary glass</p>
<p>which prevents me to see the real form&nbsp;</p>
<p>when i realize the true nature of it</p>
<p>the glass shatters and falls on me</p>
<p>hurting me and making me bleed</p>
<p>i fail to realize that knives could heal</p>
<p>i fail to realize that roses have thorns</p>
