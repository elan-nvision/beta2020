<p>Power :.      //If you ever date my daughter.//</p>
<p>Welcome my dear boy,</p>
<p>You were the person i was thinking, searching and debating for,</p>
<p>Dare you call me your second mom,</p>
<p>Call me a desired vampire,</p>
<p>Because i desire to become familiar with the smell of your blood,</p>
<p>So let you be in any pocket of the city, I'll find you, because you carry my gene with you.</p>
<p>She carries my flesh,&nbsp;</p>
<p>even when her lungs were gathering air to make her breathe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;i had my placenta protecting her body, so boy forget about having her in between your thighs,</p>
<p>I'll tear that unfamiliar hand that touches her skin,</p>
<p>Be a tiger on the battle field protect my daughter even if you think she has got shield to protect herself,</p>
<p>And if i find you protecting another girl,</p>
<p>Remember that i have learnt how to hunt animals and how flesh is to be eaten.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you come to me, remember that you hold her hand gently and fill her fingers gaps</p>
<p>Because her finger gaps never experienced the feel of air,</p>
<p>Come to me with love in your heart and smile on her face,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fall in love with her long silky hair that touches the ground like a shades of shimer added to a flowing water fall,</p>
<p>Fall in love with her heart that increases it's beat on every breath of yours that her body will experience.</p>
<p>Fall in love with her matte black shade of her eyes that shines bright when sun reflects on to them,</p>
<p>Fall in love with her soul that will return back to you.</p>
<p>My husband is a beast and she is his princess,</p>
<p>And i am the walls of their kingdom, protecting them untill i tremble,&nbsp;</p>
<p>i will take up your destruction,</p>
<p>&nbsp;but when it reaches them, I'll turn into a mirror and reflect the bomb on you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if i find scars on her body,</p>
<p>I swear your skin will forget to reform, you blood will forget to flow and your veins will forget it's colour.</p>
<p>I was thinking about you even before we were expecting to have her,</p>
<p>I was watering the plants before i sowed the seed.</p>
<p>And welcome my dear boy,</p>
<p>You have entered a place where daughters are more than your God's, more than your believe, and more than your manly existence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With every dirty look of yours, you'll find a sphinx guarding her safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for coming here boy, next time please get your parents along.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
