<p>Dear me :&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dated back</p>
<p>To&nbsp;</p>
<p>My 15 year old self&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear me&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">I know you are dealing with a lot of issues off late .This year has been particularly tough . So many things happened .You might feel as if you are losing control over everything and it's not worth it to trust anyone or to be emotionally attached to someone. It is natural to feel let down by others because we have a tendency to expect so much from everyone but don't let your emotions take the better of you , everything will be alright soon . </span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">I know you and Arpit were the best of friends , lived in the same neighborhood , studied in the same class , travelled in the same bus and did so many things together .You literally grew up with him , shared so many moments , so many firsts with him .He was not any other friend of yours , he was family . He was home. He was a part of your routine , he was always there ,always around  . Sometimes it feels so unreal on how two people who are not connected by blood become so important for each other . It becomes impossible to imagine one without the other. There is no need to think twice before saying anything stupid or inappropriate in front of each other .They would understand your silences , mood swings and what not . Arpit was that person to you. He was the first person who would come to your mind when you have to share some major news . </span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">You know , sometimes you expect others to feel the same about you and do the same things for you as you do for them . You want your feelings to be reciprocated . But it is not right to feel this way . Not everyone in your life would go to lengths for you .Your actions or feelings will not be reciprocated always and you need to accept this and move on anyway . </span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">He was with someone ,they were together and obviously you were very happy for him . You never thought that a new relationship in his life would affect your friendship with him . It is difficult to see your best friend drifting apart , avoiding you , making you feel left out just because that girl wanted him to do these things . One day he came and asked you to never talk to him again , to leave him alone .You tried to reason it out , asked him want went wrong , what happened but everything in vain . He had already made up his mind . You wondered how a simple friendship would affect a relationship , what problem would the girl have with you and why it all came down to choosing one .You never expected this to happen , you felt betrayed , you never knew that 15 year old friendship would end like this or maybe it would end at all but it did .</span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">You need to understand that a person is what he chooses , what he decides. It is good for a shallow person like him to leave your life as early as possible , you are better off without him . You will find a lot of amazing people in your life and make sure that you don't let this one bad incident affect your other relationships . You may find it difficult to trust others but soon you will overcome it , there are a lot of amazing people out there. You will have a fair share of good and bad moments with them ,try to embrace both. It will make you strong. I am not saying that the path ahead would be more difficult than what it is now but be ready for anything that might come . You know what will happen in the future ? You will look back and say whatever happened , happened for good . It made you a better person . </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">Yours lovingly</span></p>
<p>Future self&nbsp;</p>
