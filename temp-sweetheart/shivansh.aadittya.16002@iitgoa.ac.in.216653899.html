<p>People say love is everywhere, but my love lives in you. They dream of living together but I dream of being together. At night my sky is you and at day my sun. You gave me purpose of life. Your thoughts inspires me to be better everyday so I can be worthy for my heart's queen and my mind's power. Nothing is perfect in this world but I am lucky as I found an exception.&nbsp;</p>
