<p><strong>WINTER</strong></p>
<p>When Winter comes for war,&nbsp;</p>
<p>You shall hear no lions roar.</p>
<p>When Winter forces you to yield,&nbsp;</p>
<p>No stags shall graze upon the field.</p>
<p>When Winter creeps upon you from the shadows,</p>
<p>No rose shall bloom from the meadows.</p>
<p>When Winter breaks havoc on the land,</p>
<p>You can bet, there'll be no snakes in the sand.</p>
<p>When Winter brings to life all if finds grim,</p>
<p>The Krakens will freeze where they swim.</p>
<p>When Winter sets and the land begins to shiver,</p>
<p>The Flayed man will start to rot and wither.</p>
<p>When Winter fights to the last sliver,</p>
<p>No more Trouts shall swim in the river.</p>
<p>When Winter ravages and all despair, No Falcons shall fly high in the air.</p>
<p>When Winter shows you what happens when snow falls,</p>
<p>Not even Dragon Breath shall warm you inm your halls.</p>
<p>When winter comes with all its might,</p>
<p>Only wolves shall howl in the night.</p>
