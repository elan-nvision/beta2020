<h3>Of romance with power</h3>
<p>Wading through the darkness</p>
<p>Past trees bent over in salute</p>
<p>A man shudders into the cove</p>
<p>Of sinful absolute</p>
<p></p>
<p>He sets alight the torches</p>
<p>And settles upon cold stone</p>
<p>The embers crackle a gentle hum</p>
<p>And warm his frigid bones</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the fall of night he comes</p>
<p>With the grin of dawn he's gone</p>
<p>But his evil mistress lurks on</p>
<p></p>
<p>In her he finds his solace</p>
<p>When the light begins to fade</p>
<p>He feeds upon her malice</p>
<p>To satisfy he hunger for pain</p>
<p></p>
<p>Throughout dusk he shelters</p>
<p>In her malevolent embrace</p>
<p>For her sinister grace</p>
<p></p>
<p>He welcomes the wicked deeds</p>
<p>She wishes for him to do</p>
<p>For until daylight cracks</p>
<p>he is hers to rule</p>
<p></p>
<p>He is but a broken man</p>
<p>Shattered from within</p>
<p>His eyes show no emotion</p>
<p>But his grief</p>
<p>Urges him to sin</p>
<p></p>
<p>He is just for her a tool</p>
<p>An instrument for destruction</p>
<p>A canal to channel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her vengeful annihilations</p>
<p></p>
<p>His weakening frame withers</p>
<p>Insanity a repreive</p>
<p>But yet he holds on</p>
<p>To betray his mistress, He cannot concieve&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reduced to just a vessel</p>
<p>To hold the mistress's animus</p>
<p>A husk charred from disease</p>
<p>A shell that has grown gangrenous</p>
<p></p>
<p>Until at last</p>
<p>The vessel cracks</p>
<p>Screams of agony</p>
<p>Render the scene black</p>
<p>The mistress seethes in rage</p>
<p>Her gnarled fingers claw his back</p>
<p>He turns around to face</p>
<p>The grotesque reality he had</p>
<p></p>
<p>She emanates pure evil</p>
<p>Her intentions just to hurt</p>
<p>To obliterate all meaning</p>
<p>And smile in the dust</p>
<p>Her eyes glint with spite</p>
<p>Tainted with years of rust</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hope leaks out of his wounds</p>
<p>In vain he tries to run</p>
<p>He crumbles on to the floor</p>
<p>He knows he is done</p>
<p></p>
<p>A last struggle to escape</p>
<p>He comes full circle</p>
<p>She reaches out for his throat</p>
<p>On his own hands he chokes</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
