<p>Though beauty is not a race ,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes ! It is always a praise ,</p>
<p>Born little in some corner ,</p>
<p>It is rear,</p>
<p>Growing slow -slow&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beauty is every where a glow,</p>
<p>Frequent blow,</p>
<p>Merely flow ,</p>
<p>It is all in one's heart,</p>
<p>No where in that face ,</p>
<p>But then is judged whether some one is fair so ,</p>
<p>Though beauty is not a race ,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes ! It is always a praise ,</p>
<p>Thoughts are the beauty's base ,</p>
<p>Not necessary but it takes , every where itself its space  ,</p>
<p>It exists every where but not everybody can see it in every one ,</p>
<p>Beauty is you-me,</p>
<p>It is the whole world ,</p>
<p>Though beauty is not a race ,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes ! It is and it will always be a praise .</p>
