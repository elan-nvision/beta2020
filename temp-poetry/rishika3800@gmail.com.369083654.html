<p>Suffering</p>
<p>I drag my feet,</p>
<p>And walk like a zombie,</p>
<p>Lazy and groggy,</p>
<p>To board the bus,</p>
<p>I already wonder what I'd do after I go back home,</p>
<p>And quickly hate the idea of me sitting in my room staring at the screen with all those dead eyes staring back at me,</p>
<p>Then you catch my eye,</p>
<p>Little human,</p>
<p>Gushing about how your day is going to be,</p>
<p>With the whole world reflecting in your eyes,</p>
<p>You talk a mile a minute,</p>
<p>That toothy grin,</p>
<p>You wake my heart up,</p>
<p>You remind that I was once a wild little girl,</p>
<p>With no care in the world,</p>
<p>Naive,</p>
<p>Happy,</p>
<p>Alive,</p>
<p>You put a smile on my face for a few seconds,</p>
<p>And just like that I snap back to reality,</p>
<p>When I hear the honk of the bloody bus.</p>
<p></p>
