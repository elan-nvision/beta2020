<p>Dear 28 year old me,</p>
<p>I hope this letter finds you in good place. I once heard Biswa(yes, the mast aadmi!)say that to achieve something in your life you atleast need to give yourself 10 years. No, I don't expect any achievements from you, unlike the 8 year old me. But I fear that you might become a part of that herd, working for the 9 to 6 jobs, making life bland that's hard to gulp down. I am here to remind you that you are the imperfectly blissful soul who believes in mistakes rather than success. I hope your everyday is as surprising as my today. Hey, did you find that girl with whom hours feel like seconds and every second is a moment? Too much romance!!! Anyways, it must have brought you a smile. Keep that smile, its priceless. I know I am acting like mom, giving you the do's and don'ts but then that's a part of loving someone, right? So I shall end this letter with 2 more instructions</p>
<p>1. Keep being the reason for someone's smile</p>
<p>2. I know you love getting lost but don't lose those precious people you have got.</p>
<p>Till then wish me luck for the countless adventures that I am gonna make :)</p>
