<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Trepedation</strong></p>
<p>In a world so wide,</p>
<p>I haven't a place to hide.</p>
<p>Everywhere I go,</p>
<p>No matter the flow.</p>
<p>The eyes I see,</p>
<p>Are always on me.</p>
<p>Even with no-one around,</p>
<p>It feels like I've been found.</p>
<p>What is this fear?</p>
<p>That drives me from here?</p>
<p>That makes my heartbeat faster,</p>
<p>Without any answer.</p>
<p>Infront of people with no sequel,</p>
<p>I stand unequal.</p>
