<p><strong>Eclipse</strong></p>
<p><em>Theme: Suffering</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Come sit down, I have a confession to make</p>
<p>Often I peek into your room in the dark</p>
<p>And I see you lost in the shadows</p>
<p>Moving like a ghost in the night</p>
<p>My daughter, my baby, my whole heart.</p>
<p>I have so much to say to you</p>
<p>But the words, they refuse to leave my mouth</p>
<p>And remain wrapped around my tongue, unspoken.</p>
<p>I want to tell you that I know,</p>
<p>I’ve seen it all too</p>
<p>You think you’re broken beyond repair</p>
<p>But my darling, that’s not true</p>
<p>You’ll pick yourself up before you fall apart</p>
<p>Just like I did, too</p>
<p>I know this feels like the end of the world</p>
<p>But you have your whole life ahead of you,</p>
<p>My child, if only you knew.</p>
<p>You can keep on hiding in your room</p>
<p>Like a wilted flower, gone out of bloom</p>
<p>But please don’t give up, not now, not so soon</p>
<p>For you were meant to shine on like the moon.</p>
<p>These scars you wear like second skin</p>
<p>Smile and cover them up, for just one day</p>
<p>The tears that feel like they’d drown you</p>
<p>Smile and wipe them off, for just one day</p>
<p>The heartbreak threatening to choke you</p>
<p>Smile and let it go, for just one day</p>
<p>Just one day.</p>
<p>Can you be a hero for just one day?</p>
