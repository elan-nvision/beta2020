<p>[Dated back to the 14-year-old me in 2014’s December]<br> <br>To the girl, I love the most,<br> <br>If you are still wondering who is this addressed to then let me assure you that it is indeed for you.<br> <br>My heart aches bitter-sweetly when I think about you. From where I am right now, everything that I have come to love came from you and so I just want to take this time to thank you for holding on to the bits of your sanity and giving me so much.<br>I am not going to make this piece of stringed words into a long speech of lingering around your future, warning you or telling you to study hard and the basic shenanigan, because you and I both hate clichés. So, let’s move on.<br>I am writing this to make you feel comfortable during the most fragile moments of your life. You are on a hormonal surge and I am sure your biology teacher is going to teach you all that textbook facts but the real talk is that your body is going to change real drastically. A lot will be curvier but don’t worry you won’t have it any other way either. <br>You might want to continue basketball even after finishing high school though because boy is PCOD a pain in the arse. Don’t worry I am trying to curb it as well as I can, but you know life is nothing without coffee…so…. never mind.<br>Also, you will be proud to know that coming out of the closet was as liberating as we had thought. People around you will be soon more understanding. There is still hope for humanity. I would still recommend you leave that part to the 17-year-old you though because she does it better.<br>You have grown to love yourself more and everything seems fine. I would like to thank you for struggling so much and sacrificing a lot. Everything is worth it. You might not have figured out it yet but you ended up doing what you always wanted.<br>I’ll end this by letting you know that I received your letter as well and I hope the 23-year-old us reminiscence about this moment and finally write that letter she has been procrastinating about. <br>It is going to be hard and very long- that is what she said, dang! You are still doing it, what I wanted to say was that the end of high school is going to be difficult so just breathe and crack on with it. I leave everything in your smart and capable hands.<br>So long.<br> <br> <br>Lots of love and hope<br>Yours forever<br>SWARNIMA<br>[Currently 20.]</p>
