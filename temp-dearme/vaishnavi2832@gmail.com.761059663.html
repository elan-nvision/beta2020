<p>Dear me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should stop believing in people cause someday they are going to leave you and you are going to be all alone in the end. Some people are going to come into your life saying they are going to be there for you  every time.... Do not believe them. Just live the life you want to don't let anyone rule you. Never listen to the society cause they don't know your actual worth and criticize you. Study isn't the only thing that is going to make ones future bright... Be soon to decide your talent. Never be an Introvert cause people can never understand you.. Never suppress your feelings...&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally be who u want to be not what the society want you to be...&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
