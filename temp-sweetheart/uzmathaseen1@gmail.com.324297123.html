<p>TITLE-THE HIM I DON'T  KNOW</p>
<p>I saw him gazing at the sky,</p>
<p>filled with stars and the moon,</p>
<p>It was an enchanting sight,</p>
<p>His soul seemed so pure</p>
<p>At first I thought could he be an angel,</p>
<p>As his aura was angelic,</p>
<p>That no man could ever have,</p>
<p>He was nicely dressed and his hair were neat,</p>
<p>His eyes sparkling with light,</p>
<p>And my heart skipped a beat.......</p>
<p>Couldn't got off my eyes from him,</p>
<p>but running late for home,</p>
<p>I thought -Should i go talk to him as he seemed to be alone,</p>
<p>The blewing breeze made me jealous as it ruffled his hair,</p>
<p>It said u cant even touch him just as i stare.....</p>
<p>The magic in him that only i could see,</p>
<p>He's one of a kind,that no guy can ever be.</p>
<p>That I stood there amazed for a while,</p>
<p>His voice was like a rising storm,&nbsp;</p>
<p>he had the most handsome face,</p>
<p>He said to me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>could u please wait for a while,</p>
<p>And I nodded my head and gave  a foolish smile.......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>with love ....</p>
<p></p>
