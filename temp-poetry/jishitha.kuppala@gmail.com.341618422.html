<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>A new abyss</strong></p>
<p>I don't know why&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just feels like all has come untie</p>
<p>Fell for someone who never knew</p>
<p>All the butterflies slowly turned blue</p>
<p>The love didn't die</p>
<p>But the pain did amplify</p>
<p>The tears never dried</p>
<p>The sorrow alone left allied</p>
<p>How is my heart in the hand of someone so unfamiliar yet so dear?</p>
<p>Why does my heart ache for them so clear?</p>
<p>To know I'll be hated when met</p>
<p>Is a reality I often forget</p>
<p>For I have loved them so deeply&nbsp;</p>
<p>everything seems so dreamy.</p>
<p>Yet the sense of rejection</p>
<p>Is the truth about my abjection.</p>
