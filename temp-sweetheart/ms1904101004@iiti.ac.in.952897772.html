<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>She didn’t did really go.</strong></span></p>
<p>Am feeling cold! Are the humans around me disappearing or is it just a cold wind. It’s a little foggy and dark. There are wet pebbles below which I can barely feel with my numb feet. I can’t see any human-like figure anywhere around me. But am hearing a melody in the distance. It’s a familiar voice. Its been many years since I last heard that voice. Its calling my name, and every step I take, makes me warmer from within.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I approach closer to that voice, I can see a heap of fire. Now I’m able to understand where that warmth was coming from. Its a lonely fire but roaring magnificently. I see a lady in marriage gown standing, looking intently at the burning fire. I cant make out who she is as her back is towards me but there’s a strange familiarity to that voice. I approach closer and the melody she was singing stops, and she speaks,</p>
<p>“I have waited far too long for you, but you never came, and its almost time for us to depart.”</p>
<p>She turns to me and I am dumbstruck, realizing who she is. She holds my hand and pulls me closer. I can feel, her hands are cold, but the fire is keeping us warm. She hugs me and then begins to leave. I don’t leave her hand and asks her to stay. She says,</p>
<p>“Don’t stop me, let me go, I have to. Don’t make it harder for me, It already is.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear, U know I’ll always accompany you wherever you go. There’s no me without you, you know it.”</p>
<p>She says “You cant come there where I am going, its a lonely path.”</p>
<p>I hold her hand with our finger intertwined and say to her, “Lets take a walk”</p>
<p>She asks me to make a promise that I wont open my eyes as long as we are together today. And I hesitantly agree to this odd request. As we walk, I feel that all the darkness and coldness is vanishing away and its becoming warmer. I think we are close to that fire. It is as if the fire is lit inside me too and am now warm from within. We sit down on a feathery seat which sinks halfway. She says that she wants to stay in my arms for a while. I want to open my eyes and see her smile, but as if she knew it before I could even think of it and dares me to open my eyes. We stay in each other's arms and fall asleep.</p>
<p>When I wake up, I see that she is nowhere to be found and all that remains in my arms are the pieces of woods. And what I thought of as feathery seat are the ashes of those woods. Even though I was sitting in the fire, there are no burns on my body. There is no fire outside and no “she”. All that remains is me sitting in a cold foggy morning with burnt woods and warmth within. That night maybe she left a part of herself inside my heart. I will live a while longer with her being more closer to me as she ever could have been. I don’t feel cold, am warm from within.</p>
