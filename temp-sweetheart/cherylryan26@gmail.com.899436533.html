<p>Muse<br><br>Oh, sweet love, <br>many a soul came before,<br>but to you I shall appear<br>for you, called to me.<br>In your lucid dreams<br>reckoning in our dues.<br><br>I know not how you<br>see me in the eye of your mind.<br>Do my wings reach over our heads?<br>Or is my hide iridescent?<br>A piece lost in you is to<br>a void found in me.<br><br>The arrows have struck us, alike, <br>for your prayers are etched on my feathers.<br>And I hear you as<br>clear as I see you within.<br>Have you not fashioned me to beseech,<br>for a weapon fit to kill you?<br><br>Now, the dawn of the night is forthcoming.<br>And Selene resides in me.<br>I lay you down in my arms,<br>our lips collapsing at once.<br>Then you cease to exist as I am erased, <br> with my knife in your heart sealing our stars.<br><br><br>And you shall seek salvation in your muse.<br>Forever in the heavens below, we dwell as one.</p>
