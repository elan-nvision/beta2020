<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Times New Roman;">If you need to have your severed head put back, after you were clinically dead for two days, relax. Modern medicine can do it. Curing shoulder aches is different.</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Times New Roman;">I told my family doctor and he prescribed a pain killer. The painkiller was a pain and it was a killer, but it did nothing to kill the pain in my shoulder. Instead, it worked on every other part of my body, and I started throwing up. He gave me an antidote and I went back to my pre-painkiller state. I clutched my shoulder and ran out thanking modern medicine.</span></p>
