<p>Dear 16yo me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things are pretty rough exactly at this time of the year and I'm proud that you'll be able to handle it in a very mature manner. Friends you make at this  are the ones who'll stick with you till date. I love you for being you and not going to lie, life is going to teach you so much. Just be patient and self confident. People will love you for who you are and all the existential crisis you went throught at that age will be gone. Also.. let me tell you, dont stress about your obese body. You're going to achieve your dream(just nearly :p) body. üíï&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours affectionately,&nbsp;</p>
<p>20yo you ‚ù§</p>
