<p>- BREAKTHROUGH THE CAGE OF PATRIARCHY -<br><br><br>Don't drag me into your cage.<br><br>I don't want to be hurt and left in a cage. <br><br>Don't bring the bars of this cage closer to trap better.<br><br>I love myself<br><br> I want to protect myself so,<br><br>Let me out! Free as I can be!<br><br>Don't hold too tight.<br><br>Don't paint blood.<br><br>Don't be the reason for a loss.<br><br>In this world filled with chaos,<br><br>let my voice be heard and let me shine.<br><br>No curse can break my vision<br><br>when I'm building the 'me' I envisioned.</p>
