<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">However on the flip side, there are several repercussions as well. The modern world is slowly turning into a dystopian society where humans are becoming more and more mechanical and machines are getting smarter and more human.
