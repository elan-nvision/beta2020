<p>To my 15 year old self</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="" target="_self">Dear Pooh,</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is your future self. Oh! I know its hard to believe that it’s me while looking at this excellent<br>penmanship. However your constant efforts have resulted into me winning ‘<em>The award for the most Beautiful Handwriting' </em>at college. So coming back, the intention of this letter is to let you know that your life ahead is just like a rollercoaster ride.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pooh you are in Grade 10 at the moment and you will soon start preparing for one of India’s toughest examinations- The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE). Its only a few months before you change your school to switch to the CBSE Board and that willdefinitely be a huge change. This also reminds me that you will have to deal with an entire bunch of new classmates who may perform acts of selfishness which might hurt you at times. At these times you have to remember to not get influenced and stay the same – pure and genuine. There will be many who will behave like crabs illustrating the <strong>'Crab Theory'</strong> ( A theory which states that when two crabs are kept in a bowl, and one crab tries to climb up, the latter pulls it down and when the latter tries to climb up, the former pulls it down)in real life and letting you down. You always have to believe in yourself and keep going. Now enough of teaching you how to deal with people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me brief you with the ‘shocks and surprises’ of Grade 11. So for your first chapter of Math you will be taught ‘Integration’ which is symbolised by something that looks like a snake. Believe me, its going to be difficult and initially you might even find it useless. Not only this you might find your education till Grade 10 useless when your Chemistry teacher will tell you to write the electronic configuration of elements as 1s 2s 2p and so on and not 2,8,8 and so on. Oh! My idea is not to scare you but to tell you that it’s going to be very different from where you are right now and it will be absolutely normal to find it difficult. I am confident that you will learn to cope if you give it enough time. So don’t worry about this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you should worry about is the fact that you are growing healthier day by day and that ‘tragic’ day is not far when you will stop fitting into the cute and colourful clothes having tags which read ‘<strong>Age Group -15-16 years.’ </strong>I know this is heart breaking and extremely depressing. So don’t waste time and stop eating chocolates right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I mentioned that you are growing healthier. But according to everyone at home you will have suddenly started growing wiser too and your ears will be tired of listening to the words, <em>“You are no more a kid.”</em> You will hear this almost a zillion times a day. So you will have to sit and patiently explain it to them that you are no<br>more a kid but you are also not an adult right now. However think before you crack those jokes because now I realise that they are a bit too lame. (Please don’t mind sweetheart)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that this year you will be appearing for your board exams(the first milestone) but don’t let that fear not let you participate in the extra curricular activities. You are bestowed upon with the prestigious badge of a house captain and you must be an all rounder. Your top priority must be your studies but you should also not forget that this is your last year at this school as I told you earlier. So enjoy your hobbies and never hesitate to<br>take part in debating competitions because that is indeed one of your hidden talents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, remember that you must have the best smile on your face every time you look at yourself in the mirror. I am super proud of what I am today and of course the credit goes to you sweetheart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours loving,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Future Self,</p>
