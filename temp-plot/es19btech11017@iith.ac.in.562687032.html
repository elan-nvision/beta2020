<p>I looked down forlornly at the mangled, yellow and sweet flesh which lay on the kitchen slab expelling its bodily fluids and juices all over the place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had tried my best, I really had. But everything went south the second my knife touched its hard, cold, heart. As I yanked my knife free, slimy fluids spurted out of the cut I had made, making everything way more disgusting and slippery that necessary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I then abandoned trying to cut it up and decided to skin it instead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The knife glided under its skin as though it was moving through butter â€” for about two seconds. Everything spiralled out of hand the next moment when majority of its skin tore away from the rest of it with a huge chunk of flesh still hanging on to it. The disgusting, wet, squelching noise it made haunts my sleep to this day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In utter desperation, I threw down my knife, curled up on the floor of the kitchen and cried.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had murdered my mango.</p>
