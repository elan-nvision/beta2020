<p></p>
<p>It goes down the road and&nbsp;</p>
<p>then up the hill, you don't know</p>
<p>where you want to go for real,</p>
<p>but you change your path through</p>
<p>the way, without knowing, where</p>
<p>&nbsp;the path you choose will fade away.</p>
<p>Still, you carry the journey&nbsp;</p>
<p>through the way, cause you</p>
<p>believed to go through the way</p>
<p>knowing that it might not be safe</p>
<p>or having any idea of destiny it takes.</p>
<p>Resting over the milestone on</p>
<p>the night so cold that it could have&nbsp;</p>
<p>chilled without the warmth of the faith&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the way too dark that I would&nbsp;</p>
<p>have been lost without the light,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;and your touch and feel.</p>
<p>We reach the end of the path of dark</p>
<p>and had a fall there, neither swiftly</p>
<p>nor willingly but with the darkness was endured.</p>
<p>It was your light, which was bright of all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and we never realized that we had it all,</p>
<p>not from that moment, but the start,</p>
<p>&nbsp;or maybe when you choose me for the worst days of yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With dangling feet and rushing hands, we wnt that far</p>
<p>when hope was falling, you showed it all.</p>
<p>Now the light is brightest of all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;with the darkness of zillion voids of stars.</p>
<p>It was the light,</p>
<p>with which we traveled till the fall,</p>
<p>which became more beautiful in the end.</p>
<p>It traveled in time but remained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It reaches infinity and eternity, and beyond, the wise man cannot tell its end,</p>
<p>or maybe it is just beyond the world in existence.</p>
