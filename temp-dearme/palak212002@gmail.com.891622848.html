<p>Dear me,</p>
<p>As the wind whistles crossing me,my soul reminds me off all my bitter  memories. I know it was a struggle but I'm glad that I fought it,but in this fight I seem to have lost my loved ones.life has given me many punches straight on my face, so now I would like to guide my future not to be like me in the past.<span style="color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Your thoughts are like boomerangs.</span> <span style="color: rgb(33,37,41);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">What you pass along to others is what will come back to you. Never allow ego overpower you. A</span>mind that's  changed my some new thoughts can never go back to it's old dimension. So the experience of my past has taught me not many wonderful lessons. Get lost in yourself to find the new you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Live life to fullest.</p>
<p>Be grateful  for everything you owe</p>
<p>&nbsp;Defeat is not bitter unless you know how to swallow it. Learn to forgive it will improve you. Make your thoughts positive and broad minded so that any narrow situation cant stop you. Never stop being even if the world around you is not good&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rule your mind or it will rule you,never allow the voices of your fears win over the voices of your soul. The love and happiness  which you are searching in this whole world lies in the smallest of acts like helping someone, respecting your parents etc.</p>
