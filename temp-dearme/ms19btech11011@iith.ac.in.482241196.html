<p>Dear me at 15,</p>
<p>Yeah it's me, sweet talk at the end.</p>
<p>Directions for you to follow:</p>
<p>You love dancing with Maa. Give me a memory of us dancing with Dad. Let's fight more with our little sister because she's all grown up to this sweet and <br>caring girl and it's so weird. Even while writing this I miss grandpa so you know what to do.</p>
<p>We are emotionally screwed even to this day, But I love it. Stop trying to look all tough and cool. You are thinking about wrong girl right now for all the wrong reasons. And yes songs do make us cry. Standing in balcony at night and crying is better than crying in the shower, took me a while to figure that out.</p>
<p>Stop listening to pop you hate that, start exploring the history no more hints<br>Anime is not for kids you retard. Maybe get into habit of reading because you haven't read anything except science fiction till now. Let's watch sunrise once in a while. Lets dance in the rain. Stop thinking you really want to learn the drums. When he calls you to share your thoughts please go! Don't think a lot about making new friends you have one. And I recently made lots of new ones. That last window side seat of the bus is lucky for you, Someone will sit beside you someday and change your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S- You are exactly the man you want to be.</p>
