<p>Venus <br><br>When I witness the heavens, <br>Strewn with glitters and sprinkled lights,<br>I reason that, like the eclipse<br>Aligning to a perfect phenomenon<br>We, were designed to touch and unravel.<br>The cosmos, did for us, moved. <br>And before I close my eyes,<br>I desire to hear your voice.<br>That is as sweet as the first chirp of Robin,<br>And as warm as the first ray of dawn.<br>Every breath, around you slows down in itâ€™s <br>Rapid fashioned life just to admire,<br>Not only the beauty but the madness<br>Inside of you, that is too hard to let go.<br>Loving you is a touch of Venus,<br>And that perfect, in your name, you are. <br></p>
