<p>Cycles</p>
<p>Tracing autumn leaves on note books,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sit back and see how</p>
<p>My school blew them into classrooms,</p>
<p>And now, my college does that too.</p>
<p>But the leaves are yellower than ever,</p>
<p>And dry and delicate and bitter.</p>
<p>In a different time, in a different city</p>
<p>Not many winters ago,</p>
<p>The leaves were ochre and tuscany,</p>
<p>And smelt of some sweet dampened secret.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen all doors close?</p>
<p>Have you ever been that close?</p>
<p>That you shut your own door and spiral down&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like an autumn leaf on the ground.</p>
<p>It is strange,&nbsp;</p>
<p>To only remember how it ended</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, some mornings begin with Kalidasa,</p>
<p>His poetry- rich and sublime</p>
<p>It is full of faults, and we see</p>
<p>How centuries-old poetry cements convoluted conceptions,</p>
<p>It is the power of verse alone, that can stir even the dead</p>
<p>On some mornings, we read ancient Tamil poetry</p>
<p>Versified by Ilanko, where chaste women&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default have absent husbands,</p>
<p>And Kannaki's rage like a wildfire grows</p>
<p>The idea that angry women are goddesses</p>
<p>And women otherwise, are chaste.</p>
<p>But predestination, is the idea that grips me-</p>
<p>Do we already know,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The things about to happen to us?</p>
<p>It is not we but they, the text says</p>
<p>And without knowing the journey,</p>
<p>Are we destined(./?)</p>
<p>Questions are a means without an end</p>
<p>And they flow unaware in a single direction, oblivious</p>
<p>So I ask,</p>
<p>Why can’t our new lives, have old people?</p>
<p>Truth speaks, when you perceived</p>
<p>You saw them in it, but you outgrow sepia-hued pictures</p>
<p>And photo frames fail to stretch across your high-walled boundaries.</p>
<p>The remnants of that Winter, of cruel death</p>
<p>Now lies cold in a picture, alone.</p>
<p>The pain comes alive and ignites my memory,</p>
<p>The spark that was; consumes me in slow flames</p>
<p>I wish,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could live my mornings in a better way</p>
<p>Inhale the tang of fresh shiuli and feel it’s cool breath</p>
<p>But my mornings are broken,&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the trail of faded wild blossoms from the last ever night&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feeling like no young heart ever should- caught within opposing time zones,</p>
<p>There is no belonging for people like me.</p>
<p>Our brains are caught up in the grey spaces forever,</p>
<p>This generation withdraws from itself.</p>
<p>Help condemned and without hope, we remember the pain</p>
<p>And in that the end,</p>
<p>For our pain is bottomless, baseless, barren</p>
<p>Sprouting nothingness, not even weeds</p>
<p>It sheds, losing itself l</p>
<p>Just like an autumn leaf within us.</p>
<p></p>
