<p>Let even our vellus hairs groom each other only in the thousandth of our lives;</p>
<p>Yet let us move towards each other ever so slowly;</p>
<p>Like the calm breeze that makes the solitary leaf of a wild vine dance in anticipation of the the rain that comes to quench its thirst...</p>
<p>And yet unlike it for being a millonth slower.</p>
<p>And in that movement, be still.</p>
<p>Let our love move us ever so slowly</p>
<p>Like Gravity;</p>
<p>humble to a fault,</p>
<p>fleeting in the closest of scrutiny,</p>
<p>Yet.</p>
<p>the Mover of gargantuans</p>
