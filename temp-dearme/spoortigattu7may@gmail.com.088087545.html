<p>&nbsp;To the time I was 8 :  Dear Me, I know you are about to fall in love with one of the best sports this world has ever known. Nothing will draw you as much as that racket you are about to hold, and the shuttle that will make you want to just shoot it to the other side of the court. You will yearn to learn more, to venture even further into its understanding and to try and make a career out of it. Nonetheless, you will be told that taking a sport seriously is just a funny and risky thing to do. In spite of having a Mom so supportive, however, you'll fail to acquire the right amount of belief and trust from the two most important people in your life.  You’ll slowly start to give up on what was thought to be your life's ambition. Regardless of the circumstances you do not give up on the game, your one true love, in its entirety because you know for a fact that there is a little hope left, some miracle that might take you a step closer to your dream. Something seemingly miraculous will happen exactly five years later when you end up in a stadium for an everyday coaching for Badminton until the place is shut down for government purposes. You curse those officials, then your luck, for the upsetting turn of events and this time even that little amount of hope is also dead and there's no way it can come back to life like the Phoenix from its ashes. However, you thank your stars for the improvement in your game due to the short but significant amount of training you received. This and a few other seemingly significant and small opportunities make you sad and happy at the same time. You begin to feel worthless. This sport seemed like the only thing you could make a life out of and now you find it difficult to accept the fact that you can never make anything out of it. Nevertheless, Spoorti, I want you to know that you have been brave throughout, fighting against all inhibitions and taking them as they come and I’m proud of you for it. As they say ‘good things take time’, you will eventually find out just one another quality that you possess, one such trait that will later go on to define who you are, something that will make you feel the same way you did for badminton, only stronger this time and the only thing that might possibly keep you from pursuing this trait is you. Writing is what defines you but its not going to be a piece of cake. There’s going to be times where you write like no one’s reading and times where you have absolutely no clue what to write about. Sometimes you might even feel like giving up on writing and starting something fresh. You need not worry about any of this because the harder you struggle, the better you become. From falling in love with Ruskin Bond's The Tiger in the Tunnel to Jhumpa Lahiri's The Namesake, from O Henry's The Last Leaf to Shakespeare's Hamlet, you will grow up to find a better and different version of your writing. You will realize that it does not matter if people like what you write or not, what matters is whether you have written everything that you felt from deep within or not. For, all the greatest works in the history of literature are those written with love, from the heart. To end it I would say,  I trust you not to give up on this dream, this love to write, to bring about an effect in every single person who might up reading your (our) work because even as I type this six hundred and fifty word document, I know for a fact that you aren't someone who's going to.</p>
