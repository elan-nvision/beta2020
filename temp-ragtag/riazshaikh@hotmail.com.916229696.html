<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;font-family: Times New Roman;">India is the hands down winners of the award for oxymoronic boasting with its line “we invented nothing”. Nothing, in this case, being the ‘zero’. And it would not be much of an exaggeration to say “and we invented nothing – else”. It is ridiculous that a country of a billion (and counting) with a civilization over 5,000 years old (US history by comparison is current affairs) invents nothing.</span></p>
