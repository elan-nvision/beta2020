<p>TRIVIALIZED SUFFERANCE</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember the 1994 Hindi rom-com, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun? In the subsequent twenty-five years of its release, our values have changed. We prefer justice over honour and political correctness over partiality. Even our capitalism has come to imbibe individualistic-socialist ideals. Cinema may or may not carry a message, but few movies can convey ultra-feminist views without messing up. One may not realise this in the first glance. However, HAHK is one of a few blockbusters that can boast of being a feminist world.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a part in the storyline of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun that begs for attention without getting it; Nisha and Prem suffering for love, although quite needlessly. If we speak only on Nisha (whose future was at stake), she chose to forgo a lot of opportunities, even when the right alternative wasn't so hard to see. Now I do not know if the plot was done deliberately to preserve the image of the self-sacrificing Indian woman. Though, it did point out a trait that undoubtedly exists as a cause of despair and is prominent in the women we see among us today.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Liberalisation and the increasing popularity of nuclear families have lifted a few societal pressures from the ladies. She accepts little criticism for her clothes, her kids, her job, and her views. However, is she truly free? Does she get to decide whether she wants to be a mother at all or not? We will be lying to ourselves if we say we have never come across a person who could have taken help of the law to get out of an undesirable situation, or could've just left, but never considered it a viable option. They instead chose to become the butt of our aunty-uncle jokes by losing their sanity. These stories remain ignored.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I scoured Google to look for a psychological term for silent sufferers. "The Glass Ceiling phenomenon" explains gender-based discrimination in workplaces. "Empty Nest Syndrome" describes the loneliness in parents when children leave their home. "Battered Woman Syndrome" is the weathered psychology of the abused who feel unable to leave the abusers. There was no mention of people trapped in loveless marriages, people who get pressured into something by their apparently "loving" family or people who don't seek happiness solely due to lack of support. Perhaps the term I was looking for was "Obedience".&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p>The importance of chasing happiness somehow ends up being debatable. HAHK has shied away from the subject. Moreover, the internet ranked Cersei Lannister as one of the biggest villains of Game Of Thrones when all she did was seize whatever bit of happiness she could find. The blame of broken homes often goes to the "independence" of women, as if it is supposed to malign her character. Instances of the case are present in the movie Kal Ho Na Ho, where both the leading ladies look for happiness outside their homes as their husbands could never understand them. Both suffer further consequences.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p>Human societies take pride in being the creator and the nurturer. However, it conveniently forgets that it can never justify its importance if it cannot act as the third aspect of the Trinity, that of being the destroyer. It turns a blind eye to countless families with members projecting anti-social behaviour. Every victim who chooses to stay hushed is giving the perpetrator access to the next victim. The blame can also shift partially to the section of society that controls the judiciary. After all, a dismal 6.6% conviction rate in sexual harassment charges and 21% in cases related to section 498-A aren't encouraging. In the horrific murder of a two-year-old at Aligarh, one of the accused is said to have been a severe paedophile. Why are we supposed to wait and watch until something horrific happens? Why do the innocent need to die to prove that they suffered?</p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p>Besides, social constructs aren't the only cause of silent suffering. Chances are, the unhappiness may stem from pathological causes. Gender roles dictate women to be emotional, physically inactive, meek and accommodating. Hence, any medical condition with such symptoms (may include depression, autism, ADHD, and heart diseases) go undiagnosed. More appalling than that is the underdiagnosis of Endometriosis, the leading cause of menstrual pain. Physical pain endured by women often gets downplayed to the extent of being told that the pain is imaginary. It's not even a thing of the past. I was exasperated, trying to convince my college-topper friend that her pain is not "normal" and she needs to see a doctor, regardless of mum assuring her that it will magically disappear the day she gets married.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p></p>
<p>If women wish to lead from the front, they cannot afford to trivialise their happiness and well-being. It is time we hold our women to higher standards of self-care.&nbsp;</p>
