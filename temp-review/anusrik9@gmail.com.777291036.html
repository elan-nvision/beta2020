I mean WOW. 🤩🤩 it's just awesome right!!?Who wouldn't want such a big 🏠.But I quite unusually started feeling bad for them (their families I mean) I agree it's brilliant to be so rich and popular and whatnot,But by this they just are gonna miss so many simple pleasures in their lives. Like can they come out of their homes to their hearts wish ,look out of the verendah and watch their beautiful city with their wonderful families? Can they take a stoll around the juhu beach thats so close to their house and enjoy the beautiful and breezy air all around it without being interrupted or worse surrounded by so many guards? I have heard the sayi<em>ng.. "Being happy isn't about Being r</em>ich" but it sunk into me so much that day.Its  true! absolutely... Being popular or rich will never make you happy.😌😌 After all we do in our lives, all we remember is not the huge houses, the beautifully decorated interiors, the great lifestyle you lead. NO, not any of dis.All we remember is the beautiful moments we spent happily wid our families,frnds😘, the fun we had, the crazy shit we did and most important<em>ly the M</em>EMORIES we made doing all of this.😍😍 that for me is total happiness in life.That for me is what defines life in it's complete and beautiful form..!! I hope I have stirred quite a few wonderful memories in ur minds.😊😊 MEMORIES DAT WILL STAY WITH US FOREVER.!! 😊🤗 Like they say,"WE ARE ALL STORIES IN THE END" 😍 and its all upto us to make ours Crazy, Adventurous, Thrilling and WORTH REME</span>MBERING..!! 😊😎&nbsp;</pre>
