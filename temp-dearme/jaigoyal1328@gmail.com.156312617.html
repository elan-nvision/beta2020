<p>Dear me, don't lose hope, I know it was not your mistake and by chance, your name came in between. I know how it feels when your mom cries i<strong>n front of you because of you,</strong> it has broken you from inside , papa's fearful expression makes you feel melancholy, no money in home, elder sister admitted in ICU and all other situations are against you right now,but everything will be fine very soon. Do talk to isha,she is suffering from jaundice, you will going to regret it if you didn't do that. It's a cloudly night for only 2-3 months more after that trust me a bright sun is waiting you right there and you will have the most wonderful and precious moment afterwards. The person which will come out of these toils will be a different person with <strong>more values, maturity and patience.</strong> Just remember what Deepti ma'am said-<strong><ins>what had happened is for some good thing to occur in future </ins></strong>and mind my words you will thank her to believe in you in future.</p>
<p>best wishes</p>
