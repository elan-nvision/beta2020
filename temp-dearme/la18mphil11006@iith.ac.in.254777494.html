<p><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12pt;font-family: Times New Roman;">Dear me:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12pt;font-family: Times New Roman;">Dated back: 1 Jan 2006</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12pt;font-family: Times New Roman;">Alright, listen carefully. Your best friend isn’t going to come back to this school after the summer holidays. You now have three more months until the holidays begin. Be that clingy best friend and cherish every day for three months. Also, get her damn phone number! </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12pt;font-family: Times New Roman;">After she’s gone, you might feel like changing schools. Don’t!  You are sad? Trust me babes, you haven’t seen real sadness yet, so suck it up and study there for three more years.</span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12pt;font-family: Times New Roman;">Did that? Great! Now cut your hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12pt;font-family: Times New Roman;">Yup..you heard me right. Your dad’s going to be so pleased, but there’s more to it. You’re going to look so frigging cool and pixies make life way easier.</span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12pt;font-family: Times New Roman;">The school you are now in. Talk to those dudes Joel and Grayson. They watch anime too! And, the next time you go to the browsing centre, check out Wattpad. You are going to love it! Also, it’s okay if you are missing any of the episodes on T.V. The future you has access to Youtube and has already watched them online.</span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12pt;font-family: Times New Roman;">P.S Invest in Pepper sprays. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12pt;font-family: Times New Roman;">P.P.S Say hi to your brother. You don’t talk to him anymore.</span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12pt;font-family: Times New Roman;">Love and Hugs,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12pt;font-family: Times New Roman;">Your Older you</span><br>&nbsp;</p>
