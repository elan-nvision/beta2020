<p>Butterfly Effect<br><br>A speck in this universe, was I,<br>And thee, a mad art.<br>Like aurora.<br>A dawn I canâ€™t fathom into colours.<br>But once thee did linger,<br>An eclipse.<br>When we touched, thy smothered every thought in me.<br>And oh, darling<br>It was a butterfly effect.<br>Never did I possess thine heart again.<br>No utterance in me<br>Does justice to carve this verse for you.<br>So, to silence shall I succumb.<br>Every twilight hath I,<br>Deprived,<br>Wrote letters to the moon,<br>Like a wolf in the sliver shade.<br>Unbeknownst of the distance,<br>Still did, to his lover, did croon.<br>Alas,<br>Thy wrinkles on thy nose,<br>Chagrined from the scorching sun,<br>Thy cold sighs, burn my embers.<br>Thy tresses that hath brought forth spring,<br>I remember,<br>Like dreams, that I hath made my world.<br>A mirage in which,<br>Thee and I, forever, speak love.<br>A butterfly effect, once hath moved me,<br>And now no virtue of life should instil in me,<br>If I, a speck in the universe,<br>Not know, how this world is nothing, <br>But me in you and you in me.<br></p>
