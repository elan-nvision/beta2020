<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17px;font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Hey there, it's good ol 17 year old you coming at ya. I'd like to tell you that I have it all figured out and my life is great, but that is just not true. We're still chugging along though don't worry.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17px;font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">I'd also like to tell you that life gets easier as it goes on, but again that is just not the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17px;font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Since you left for college things have gotten pretty tough. You live on your own, you're stressed out almost always, and you're flat out broke. That is pretty much the life of any college student though so we're basically on track.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 17px;font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">What I can tell you, with absolute certainty, is that you would never believe the person you've become. You aren't some weird girl with braces like you were in middle school. You are not the cheer captain but also low key band geek you were in high school. You are someone who you would be proud of.</span></p>
