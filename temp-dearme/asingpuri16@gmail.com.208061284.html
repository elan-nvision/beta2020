<p>Dear ten-year-old me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am now twice as old as you are, a decade older, and believe me, I am jealous of you. You are all I ever wanted to be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You already have a letter that dad wrote to you, telling you to live your life but to tread cautiously, as you'll enter the next decade. You don't know how to take it, and it's okay, I still don't. You'd think dad is uber cool to do so and you've got a set of cool parents there, but I'll tell you to tread cautiously too. The two people you'll ever manage to disappoint with your liberal existence are them. Am I explicitly asking you to put on a mask? Probably. I have been doing that for a while now, and it sometimes costs my happiness, but I cannot imagine my life in any other way.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>You aren't only a rebel in the making, you are a brilliant and daring person. I hope you don't lose these qualities. Shall I tell you what's in store for you in the next decade? I lost both of those qualities; one to disorders and the other to my mask. It falls apart sometimes, you know.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Life is never meant to be easy, at any age. You are old enough to understand that more often than not, you have been excluded from evening games by your cousins. It's not their fault; you were always the youngest. Please do not carry that hurt in your heart. The other things that will start hurting in a few months is your stomach. It will be the first event in a sequence of many leading to the downfall of your health. You'll hate yourself for a long time. But I almost chuckled, there will come a time when you'd pray for your body to bleed. Those will be happy times, no matter what anyone tells you.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I know you're dying to get connected to the internet. All your friends have it. Take my advice, stick to the books. When someone calls you "too young" to do something, get offended. That's how you learn, that's how you grow. Even when you can finally use the Internet, never ever feel flattered by the adult strangers who claim to want to become your friend. They are not, and will never be a friend. Minor girls persued by adult males is usually a comical reference in my time, but there's a reason it exists.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Coming back to your present, you should know that you have quite a control over your introversion, one I could never have again. Try to maintain that, will you? People will hurt, things will be challenging, but your worth will never decline. You are destined for great things. You will always remember with pride how you started reading Dan Brown at age eleven, or how you aced all school level quizzing events, or how you had been attracted towards the unknown.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Go, get a few more heartbreaks than what I ended up with. Be the bad bitch you are inside. Be bold when you say no. Be fearless each time you feel violated on public roads. Scream. Scream as loud as you can, because no one will even acknowledge it happened. Scream.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most importantly, love yourself. Be proud of who you are, complete with your qualities and follies.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hope my thirty-year-old self writes me a letter too. I could use one.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yours sincerely,&nbsp;</p>
<p>twenty-year-old me</p>
<p></p>
