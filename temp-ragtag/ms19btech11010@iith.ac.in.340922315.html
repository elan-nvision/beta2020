<p>I’m bruised oft-times. Trust me, from the very erstwhile age of mine as if I gladly welcome<br>those occurrences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The little-known people in the vicinity of a regular shop I visit, stare as if they’re expecting<br>my inbuilt-drama character on the street upon my grand entry .The next scene would<br>be me on the ground in a spur of the moment. Tragedy-O-tragedy!!&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><em>Now that I’m taking-over those kind of situations</em>, I’ve been speechless on encountering one<br>of my relatives who was dumbstruck on knowing <strong>how safe and sound I’m</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>
