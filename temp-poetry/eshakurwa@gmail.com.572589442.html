<p>THOUSAND MILES</p>
<p>As I look back to who we were,</p>
<p>As I struggle to remember,</p>
<p>All these years, all those thousand miles,</p>
<p>Can only bring up smiles.</p>
<p><br>You remember back in fifth grade,</p>
<p>Those funny games we played,</p>
<p>The fun we had in parade,</p>
<p>The comics we bade,</p>
<p>The cookies we made,</p>
<p>Those paints we sprayed….</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can we go back a decade?</p>
<p>Can we please go back to those careless smiles?</p>
<p>Can we for once , go back those thousand miles?</p>
<p><br>I still reminisce math class,</p>
<p>Where we only played XO and SOS.</p>
<p>And when the teacher came to our table,</p>
<p>I remember how we toiled to keep ourselves stable.</p>
<p><br>You remember the time we coloured our tongues blue?</p>
<p>Our dreams of having the same Dark Mark tattoo,</p>
<p>How we once refilled lotion bottle with shampoo,</p>
<p>Those essays we had to redo,</p>
<p>Because we wrote lyrics instead of book review,</p>
<p>Thinking no one’s gonna check, its all untrue…</p>
<p><br>I wish we lived that once again,</p>
<p>I wish we regrew,</p>
<p>For once, I wish we started again,  started anew.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I received your letter yesterday,</p>
<p>And it bought with it all smiles,</p>
<p>Funny how we never gave up on that old practice,</p>
<p>Funny how that letter still bonds us over those thousand miles.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
