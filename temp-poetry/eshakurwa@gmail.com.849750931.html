<p>SCARS</p>
<p>&nbsp;Its been a long time now,</p>
<p>And time heals wounds they say,</p>
<p>There are scars all over me ,</p>
<p>And I’ll just let them stay.</p>
<p><br>Wounds heal. Marks stay.</p>
<p>At least those who mark a silent prey.</p>
<p>Burning scars see revenge some say,</p>
<p>But in remission there’s peace, there’s grey.</p>
<p><br>The scars hurt this morning</p>
<p>They do all the time.</p>
<p>And I’ll let them burn,</p>
<p>For burning scars are beautiful and benign.&nbsp;</p>
