<p><em>3</em><strong>Letter to Myself on the Last day of College </strong></p>
<p><strong>Dear me, <br>        Whatever you're doing, Stop! Take a seat cos this is neither the amazon delivery you're expecting, nor a interview call letter, This *drum roll please* is a letter from the freshman you, struggling with 1st sem courses and projects. It's funny because there's a chance you remember writing this letter at 2:45 am in Oct. 2019.<br><br>        I hope you're happy and i hope you don't hate me as much as i hate myself of 4 years ago. Tell me, are you still grateful that you didn't study for classical physics exam in 1st sem? Cos not being able to write answers and quitting early got me to meet the most amazing friends i(you) could ask for. Wait, are they still your friends? Knowing myself, I'm sure you clung onto atleast a few of them, do you still have unplanned hangouts at the white blocks or have they removed them altogether? I'm sure you never asked anyone their branch, but i know branches and different courses might have cleaved our current group at different parts. Maybe you don't even regret that or maybe you do. <br>     I know how your most powerful feeling is nostalgia. How does it feel to have finished college today, you must be sad yet grateful to the time you had. I hope you still feel the same way about 'college life' because i already feel sad that all this is gonna end in just 7 more semesters. <br>     Is your Instagram bio "Mai Ekkiss ka toh ho gaya.. Lekin ek kiss tak nahi hua"? I truly hope you're in a healthy relationship with the girl i like or maybe you moved on. If somehow she's still a crush,promise me you'll let her know today. I hope you still keep your promises, still love to make your loved ones happy. <br>     What anime are you watching? Do you still like to draw and what about taking photos? Listen carefully, Open the lowest drawer of your desk. There will be an external hard drive with "yaheen bateein toh baad me yaad ayengi" written on it. It has photos and videos from my today to yours. Make sure you rediscover it with your close friends and do proper justice to what i say now, "I'll smack everyone in the face with nostalgia!". <br>      Are you still using all your fingers to count your flaws and thinking "why would anyone like me?". You might remember that i believe in having no regrets. I can't be sure of the happiness or fulfillment at the destination, that's why I'm trying to make the journey worth it. </strong></p>
