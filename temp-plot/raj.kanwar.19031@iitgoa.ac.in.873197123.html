<p>I'm a hindi medium student who didn't like to write poem, story ,script etc. because I thought that it is too boring. iI read in newspaper only sports page even if i watched that match. I read that again and again just for happiness and if india lost the match i didn't read that. As i grew up i started reading whole paper and in that my favourite part was those story's  who gave a message related to our life. In 11 and 12 class i went to sikar for foundation than i met with a people who inspired me how to manage time in study , writting, games that person was my coaching's owner and i call him BOSS. In 12 class i met with Ronak who is my best friend and i wrote some letter for her that letters were my first writting other than class notes. After came at IITGoa i inspired from my oratory club and i started writting. I'm telling thank you to all those people by those i inspired and started writting .This was my first story.&nbsp;</p>
