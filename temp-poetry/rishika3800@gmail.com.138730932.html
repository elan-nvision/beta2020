<p>Suffering</p>
<p></p>
<p>You killed my insides,</p>
<p>They are rotten now,</p>
<p>The stench tickles my nose,</p>
<p>Reminding me that nobody is gonna nurse my insides,</p>
<p>With the tenderness they crave,</p>
<p>the warmth they crave,</p>
<p>I lie there like a shell,</p>
<p>Staring at the ceiling,</p>
<p>Wishing it had all go away,</p>
<p>Waiting for it to end,</p>
<p>Only if it would.</p>
<p>The stench scares them away,</p>
<p>Sickens them,</p>
<p>OH,</p>
<p>Who could I blame,</p>
<p>They are just saving themselves.</p>
