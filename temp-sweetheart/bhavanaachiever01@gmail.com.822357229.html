<p><span style="color: rgb(95,91,91);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;font-family: Work Sans", Arial, sans-serif;">Saw you when I was eight</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thought about your intelligence you show every day in the class</p>
<p>still, remember your sharp looks and it hunts me ever</p>
<p>used to laugh at your lean legs&nbsp;</p>
<p>but always try to notice what makes you feel magical to me</p>
<p>never felt bad when you unnoticed me</p>
<p>fortunately had chat with you after six years, after Christmas</p>
<p>thought we would meet again but not happened yet</p>
<p>got an opportunity to have exchanges again with you after two years</p>
<p>thought I was getting close to you though we are apart</p>
<p>but this time it's more dramatic than ever</p>
<p>your life took you north and mine remained me in the south</p>
<p>said a lot of things to each other</p>
<p>never had a thought that you would attract to someone apart from me</p>
<p>but it did happen to you</p>
<p>miss you every day, in every important moment in my life</p>
<p>don't really know the reason why</p>
<p>my mind never stopped reminding you</p>
<p>you fell important to me but you want to give yours to someone</p>
<p>don't know what attracted you to that person</p>
<p>I wonder why can't I un-miss you though I knew this</p>
<p>never thought to leave your contact&nbsp;</p>
<p>never really hated you though I said that I was.....</p>
<p>can't help the feeling what I feel now&nbsp;</p>
<p>never tried to let you down and lie to you</p>
<p>know what feeling I have for you but never admitted to you</p>
<p>wanting to be around with you which is not possible right now</p>
<p>don't know how you look but I've felt for you</p>
<p>still feeling for you with a longing heart...............</p>
