<p>Dear me,</p>
<p>It is 2013, school gets over at 1:50PM and you reach home by 2:30PM. School is ten minutes away, but you take your time. You walk with a friend who cycles to school, while your auto uncle is getting really mad at you. You don’t care. That yellow building, which you call school, is surrounded by trees older than itself and you love walking on the cemented pathways with nothing particular in mind. I wish, I could ask you to remember how it feels to walk around with nothing on your mind, to just walk. With a hole in your left shoe, you walked outside in the August sunshine, just after the rain. Your socks got soggy but your temper remained surprisingly unblemished. You walked alone, but it never felt lonely. There was something in you that responded to the movement of the winds and the touch of seasons, pristine (for the lack of better word) and tangible. Now, it is intangible. You would talk aloud with the trees and blades of grass, now, all the talk begins and ends within the confines of your 'intellect' (supposedly making you ‘mature'). It reminds me of those evenings in October, when you would be riding home from tuitions, and the first wind of winter, kissed both your cheeks. Your insides would glow with a love both warm and cold, and you would mouth, “Winter is here” (No GOT references indicated, you were a child). Those words were spoken dreamily, skimming over a love that could have been, a love that was to be. Now, it feels as if the roads are inside me, and the winds have changed with seasons.</p>
<p>You will remember the afternoons the most, not because school got over, but you returned home. Also, that small fragment of the sky which you looked up to everyday, before entering home is going to be saved as a default souvenir. It is 2019, and I am nineteen years old. Even today, I look up at the sky at 2:30PM to find my piece of the sky, my thirteen year old heart. God knows what I saw in that sight everyday for 12 years! The cities will change, so will the people, but that bit of my sky is always going to be the same. Even though it is a fragment, it is a whole- much like you are. I don’t know how to tell you, that even in 2019, you are here. Peeping through my pastry bills, running to a 8:30AM class at 9AM, sipping my glass of honeyed lukewarm water everyday and staring at the sunlit west-facing veranda, lost in too many thoughts.</p>
<p>The one thing that you are going to take time to understand is that- the love you can give yourself has no substitutes. People are going to hate you for speaking out your mind and even more for your brave heart. You are the girl I adore and will grow up to be the woman I love. It’s a long long journey till here and you will get tired but don’t think too much; it never happens that way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take good care of yourself,</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Pronita.</p>
<p></p>
