<p>Dear me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 13&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have enterd into teenage... The age where your mind actually starts behaving wierd... You should start accepting what you have and should move on. Not all people are permanent.. Never believe anyone everytime you decide about something it should only be a debate within yourself never take the help of the society cause they at times underestimate you.. You should make the differnce  always remember this never care about the society... All they do is blabber...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally believe in yourself you can achieve wonders&nbsp;</p>
