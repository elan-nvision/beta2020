<p>-OUR DESTINED GALAXY-<br><br>My heart breaks when I see your ways.<br><br>The stars in your eyes.<br><br>The galaxy that you made,<br><br>Comforts me all the time.<br><br>I could never let go off these moments we are spending together but<br><br> I'm fearful of goodbyes<br><br>I know you too are, but we both know we will be together forever,<br><br>decorataing our galaxy.<br><br>I can never forget how you make me smile when I'm so sad.</p>
