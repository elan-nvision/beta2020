<p><strong>WHEN IT WON'T COME TO BE</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its just not enough</p>
<p>I do seek to be tough</p>
<p>Resign, I will, when I have given all too much</p>
<p>Dreary, the becoming of what I hold dear as such</p>
<p>To have to devour a mountain more than I can fathom</p>
<p>Is to return to an inglorious anthem</p>
<p>What I have to tell myself then,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When it wont come to be&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let it be".</p>
