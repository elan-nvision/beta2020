<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Times New Roman;">The principal insisted that ten real footballers were enough to win the game, and they could spare a spot for the college topper. Thank you, princy, for making my dream come true. I stayed on the sidelines, mindful of the threats I had received from my teammates. The score was tied 1-1, with 60 seconds to play. And the ball landed right at my feet. I ran with the ball and everything was a blur till the goal came into view. I kicked the ball into the net, and started screaming till my captain slapped me. 2-1, self-goal!</span></p>
