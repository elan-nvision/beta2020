<p>Let me take care of your broken heart</p>
<p>and show you how to fly.</p>
<p>Let me hold you gently by the hand</p>
<p>and kiss your tears goodbye.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let me lead you to tomorrow's light</p>
<p>and out of needless rain,</p>
<p>'cause all I want right now</p>
<p>is to see you smile again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let me sing you all the songs I wrote</p>
<p>'til you sleep in my embrace,</p>
<p>and I'll keep you safe and warm until</p>
<p>the sunlight strikes your face.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let me bring you up the mountain's peak,</p>
<p>and I'll let you touch the skies</p>
<p>to remind you of the strength I see</p>
<p>when I look into your eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let me kiss and show you what is love</p>
<p>and the happiness it brings.</p>
<p>You'll sail again like a butterfly</p>
<p>endowed with pretty wings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let me do all these to let you see</p>
<p>our fates are intertwined.</p>
<p>You're the accidental precious gem</p>
<p>I've waited long to find.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The earth and sky conspired to make us meet.</p>
<p>They knew we both belong</p>
<p>to each other like words and lovely notes</p>
<p>give life to every song.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So fly with me, my beautiful one.</p>
<p>It's time we leave the past.</p>
<p>I'm yours to keep, and you are mine.</p>
<p>We're finally home at last.</p>
