<p></p>
<p>IS IT SO BAD?&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>They say that I have changed like its something bad!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why do you look so grim? Why must you be so sad?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Life is a gift so seize the moment they say</p>
<p></p>
<p>What happened to you? Why do you keep everyone at bay?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Are you angry or mad or maybe just irritated by this and that?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Trust me no one will judge you here if you short, bald or fat.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>But who would tell them that this person I have become is who I want to be</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have changed for a reason why don’t they see?</p>
<p></p>
<p>I used to be one of them and advice those all the silent peers I saw</p>
<p></p>
<p>Life is too short to be sad was the law</p>
<p></p>
<p>But now I see from their eyes</p>
<p></p>
<p>And feel in my heart that I can truly sympathize&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>My words hold more meaning then they used to back then</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was just a naive little kid who didn’t know what to do and when</p>
<p></p>
<p>Broke many hearts and got mine broken so oft</p>
<p></p>
<p>That I ended up with guilt so deep and eyes so soft</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now even if I look at someone in pain&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>It gives them more hope than those empty words would help them gain&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why do they shush me and look at me like I have gone mad?</p>
<p></p>
<p>I know I am different but that is because now I have felt that I never had.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s not sadness without a cause&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s just that I have unlearned how to hide how painful it was</p>
<p></p>
<p>I don’t smile for others but act the way I want</p>
<p></p>
<p>How else would I have got rid of the memories that haunt?&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Oh no don’t pity me for I am not the one suffering</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pity yourself who is hiding behind that false covering</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why must you lock your heart and paint that mask?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why must you always walk that path and never let your heart ask?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being human is not a crime&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>That is a truth you will learn to accept in time.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
