<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;">If you are one who doesn’t have the slightest clue about quantum mechanics or theoretical physics and in for some witty one liners peppered with suffice humor and garnished with fine discussion on philosophy and religion, ‘Young Sheldon’ promises to take you on a rollercoaster.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The series is a spin-off prequel to the acclaimed ‘The Big Bang Theory’ and chronicles the childhood of the geeky and socially awkward Sheldon Cooper as he struggles to fit into the society.</span> <span style="font-size: 16pt;">Iain Armitage stars as the protagonist and it’s a delight to watch him on screen as he expresses a plethora of emotions questioning social norms and delivering mind boggling scientific dialogues spot on. The very first season itself establishes his personality that most of us would probably be familiar with. It’s<br>one of the very rare shows where the central character is not very likable for he fails to recognize others’ emotions, doesn’t accommodate their interest and opinions and mocks them since they are way below his superior intellect.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Zoe Perry plays Mary Cooper, the worrisome mother who’s deeply into religion constantly praying for the welfare of the family aided by a memorable Lance Barber as George Cooper-the grumpy but likeable father. But it is the siblings- Missy(Raegan Revord) and Georgie(Montana Jordan) who are the most congenial of all with<br>their impeccable comic timing and never sparing a moment to annoy Sheldon to the core. Ironically, though academically poor, they have a better go about<br>tackling issues of life and socializing with the crowd.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;">When he no longer feels academically challenged at school, Sheldon joins college to attend the lectures of Dr. John Sturgis (Wallace Shawn). Love blossoms between John and Connie(played by a brilliant Annie Potts)-Sheldon’s grandma or ‘Mee-maw’ as he calls her. On the other hand we have Georgie trying hard to woo the girl of<br>his dreams-Veronica with creative ideas which always end up as a disaster! Then we have Missy, cheerful and witty, who’s always engrossed in the fantasies of<br>her cabbage patch dolls but deep inside she’s broken as she believes no one in the family cares about her nor do they extend their affection since Mary works<br>part time at the church always worried about the whereabouts of Sheldon. The subsequent intersection of various characters and the mutual understanding they<br>tend to develop with comic relief every now and then is endearing to watch and pretty much forms the crux of the first two seasons.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;">One of the biggest strengths of the show is undeniably the casting. Everyone has bagged a meaty role and delivered their performances to sheer perfection. The background score is soothing and suits the mood of the episodes and also uses silence when necessary. Sheldon’s inability to understand sarcasm and his jealousy when he encounters a person smarter than him are absolutely hilarious. In John Sturgis he finds a role model and whenever the duo have discussions on science on the<br>dinner table, the look on the members of the family will tickle your funny bones. But there are also little elements for instance where, Sheldon realizes the concern and love his mother has for him and hugs her tightly which are heartwarming.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Although highly enjoyable, one of the letdowns of the show is that every episode is merely equivalent to an incident that occurred in Sheldon’s childhood and there<br>is no driving plot that keeps the viewers intrigued and anxious for the next episode. Also some scenes definitely feel over the top and awkward for instance<br>where Sheldon openly confronts his Mee-maw to discuss her relationship status with him and spy’s on her for a week.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;">But nevertheless, the strengths outweigh the flaws making ‘Young Sheldon’ a worth watch. Look out for the third season that is in progress in currently and I<br>would definitely recommend everyone to definitely give it a shot.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
