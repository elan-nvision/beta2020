<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's never about where you travel, it's about who you travel with", i remember the freshmen me saying this during several of the nocturnal walks we used to have back then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here i am, setting up a tripod, on the bank of a river flowing gently, alone, framing the shot which will add to the collage named 'Travelouge'. It contains 14 photos of me, standing in front of Taj Mahal, sitting in the desert, alone, looking up at the Qutb Minar, leaning against a maple tree covered in snow, alone, looking into the void distance from the edge of a boat, ALONE and much more. I set the timer to 10 seconds and start hurrying towards the spot i just framed, counting down in my head.</p>

<p>... 10.... 9....</p>
<p>I never seemed good enough for her, and it didn't have anything to do with the way she looked. She always ate odd number of breads for breakfast. She often smelled like lavender because she once read somewhere that lavender made people happier. She didn't know how to react to complements, ao she laughed, smiled in everything she said. We rarely were in the same class but you just start meeting people you love, everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way she always used to carry a novel around. She never knew, she never knew how she turned my typical college into hogwarts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>.... 8.... 7....</p>
<p>We could never be Romeo and Juliette, cos i was neither charismatic nor good at conversations. She took her time to open up as well. But in my head, we were special through our imperfections, glowing through our dimmed lights, laughing through our silences.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>.... 6... 5....</p>
<p>I tried to show her what my eyes saw, that she was mesmerizing, timid yet vibrant and utterly intimidating. But i always failed to put them into significant words and always ended up babbling a strew of self-insults.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>... 4... 3...</p>
<p>So, i just held her hand, tight. You do that for people you love, right? I let her fight her own battles, even if being helpless breaks you. And I dreamt, I dreamt we'll be sitting on the Clevedon Pier, next to each other, staring at tge orange sun dipping in the distant horizon. She'll be singing in her sweet voice that bewitched me years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>It's been 3 years and a sixth sense tells me that you're interested in someone else. I'm neither sadist enough to be jealous of him, nor am i pure enough to be happy about it. I do feel sometimes, things start to come up in the oblivion of my mind. I overthink, maybe i give up. And from the peak of the mountain i built, i jump, i jump into the hollows, hoping that you'll be there to catch me. You never were. So i climed up, again and again, only to jump all the way down again. You always seemed too good for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But i never stopped believing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>..... 1.....</p>
<p>A hand in an woolen glove presses on my soldier, i feel a soft cheek against mine, and i feel..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... a smell of lavender.&nbsp;</p>
