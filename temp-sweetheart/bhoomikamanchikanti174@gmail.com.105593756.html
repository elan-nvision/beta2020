<p>- A WAITING ON AISLE -</p>
<p>So sad that you left me,left me in a white gown, with a bouquet in hand,<br><br>A veil on my head and hopes in my blood<br><br>Petals kept falling,the night was arriving but <br><br>you never came<br><br>Were you afraid?<br><br>So sad that you left me waiting,waiting on the aisle<br><br>So sad that I want to tell and hear you but all i can do is wonder.<br><br>I see the thorns below the petals<br><br>I fly away, I fly away<br><br>This time to meet me and be better.</p>
