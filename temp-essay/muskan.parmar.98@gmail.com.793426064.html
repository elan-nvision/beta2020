<p>Once I walked on some road with bushes along the sides, and a canopy on the top, some sunrays shimmering through it and dazzling a show of light beams on the path. All of it dreams now.</p>
<p>How merciless could our race be?</p>
<p>Merciless, not on the part of nature but on our ownselves. We denied ourselves best of scenic beauty, the best of health and the best of life. We shed down trees now we shed down tears, we smoked the air and smouldered our lives.</p>
<p>But there is still some flickering flame in my eyes, which knows that humans shall befriend nature once again. We shall live those dreams once again.&nbsp;</p>
