<blockquote>&nbsp;Mr Steady. So I may have liked you. You're the closest someone's gotten to being a crush for me. I like how my general admiration turned into, well I will not use the word that starts with <strong>L</strong> has a <strong>V</strong>  ends with an <strong>E</strong> but I definitely LIKED you. Do you hear me you Sagittarian. And Cancers- Sagittarians are not even supoosed to attract. I'm big on Zodiac signs yes. You are probably my first crush. This hardcore Cancerian's FIRST CRUSH!!! You are Ms Inspiration's first probable crush.!!!! Ughhhh this is big deal!!!! I'd like to think I'm a grammar nazi but look at me so generously using all these exclamations. RIP grammer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;A lot of traits that I look for in my Ideal Life Partner, you had‚úÖ. You checked so many boxes!!! You will make a great parent I'm telling you. I'm never wrong about these things.üëå Heart emoji Heart emoji Heart emoji.</blockquote>
<blockquote>On a side note I can only imagine how entertaining this is going to be for the judges... getting to read all of our cringey, cheesy, teenage angst-filled crush, love letters, poems. Oh how I envy you guys.</blockquote>
<p>Anyway getting to the point and you should know I did my fair share of stalking. I mean at this point its an open secret.. its something everyone does when they like someone.</p>
<p>I liked how you would respect teachers and not make fun of them like the other boys in our class and then you were always nice to everyone. Being nice to people from I know is not considered a cool thing or whatever but hers's what I believe: MANNERS MAKETH MAN. I liked how you were so athleticüèä. I am anything but athletic. Opposites attract is true I guess(If only you were attracted to me lmao). I just knew you were a good person. üòáwhy I never told you you ask, because it was only deep admiration not L@VE. OR AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO THINK. (I'm just rambling at this point). And I do not do relationships (cuz I'm a complicated person). So what would me telling you that I liked you even mean? ü§î</p>
<p>And of course you broke my heart when there were rumours of you and Ms Fragrant being a couple. I even remember thinking "What does he even see in her????" sounds like such a cliche crush-girl thing to say I know. But that's literally what happened. I may have also been a tad bit jealous. I remember singing <em>I won't let the crush crush crush crush crush me.</em> Damn you Mr Steady. I have always been a resonable person; most times atleast. But when things like this happen, I turn into one of those hopeless romantics that I absolutely hate. I never knew I could be jealous with a girl over a BOY! I <span style="color: rgb(95,91,91);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;font-family: Work Sans", Arial, sans-serif;">have imagined holding you hand and hugging you (no sexual stuff whatsover lol).</span> Next time I meet you, I shalt tell you that I liked you. My parents would've liked you. Be you. Don't you ever change. Heart emoji Heart emoji Heart emoji.</p>
<p>Your forever crusher,</p>
<p>Ms Inspiration.</p>
