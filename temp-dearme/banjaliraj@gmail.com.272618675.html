<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">Dated: 17 March 2014 </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">To </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">My 13 year old self </span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">Dear Me, </span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">Happy Birthday! You're finally 13, a teenager. I'm going to tell you a few things which you should always remember.</span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">First off, you're about to experience a whole lot of changes in yourself as well as in your environment. It might be overwhelming at first. Some changes might not feel good but just remember it's all a part of life and there's nothing to be worried about. You'll also find that people might not treat you the way you want to be, but that's ok, stay yourself no matter what. Just try not to be gullible.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">There are so many things you'll learn in the coming years, so many mistakes that are inevitable and so much to look forward to. </span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">You'll feel pressured to live up to the expectations of others, stressed about exams and ended being sleep deprived on certain days, I can't give a single piece of advice that'd ensure that all these things don't happen. Because all those are natural responses to the situation. Just don't ever lose hope no matter what happens.</span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;"> I know you feel anxious while meeting new people, but try to mingle with others, you'll find some really good friends that are going to make life so much more exciting and fun. </span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">Also, take good care of your family, that's the most important thing. If I had to tell you what I regret the most today then I'd say that it is not spending enough time with them. Now I stay away from them and I miss them. Not just them, I miss arguing with brother a lot. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">I don't want to spoil everything that is going to happen, because you need to experience all of them yourself. You're going to have loads of fun in the future, I can assure you that. </span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">Once again, happy birthday and I hope you have a blast (I know you will) </span><br></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">Take Care. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">Yours lovingly</span></p>
