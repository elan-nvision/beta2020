<p>Dated back: May 19, 2018<br>To<br>16 year-old Alisha<br>Dear me,<br>The last time I wrote a letter to myself was back in 2016. Do you remember that? It was so loving and self-assured that even thinking about it makes me laugh and cringe simultaneously. I hope I never lie to myself that blatantly again. I hope I’m not doing that right now. look at those sticky notes that you’ve plastered on every available surface in your room whenever you feel like it’s all choking you. “The trick is to keep breathing”. Remember that.<br>Oh, and when the pretty boy who loves flowers and fairy lights makes your heart soar, let him. Even though it wouldn’t end well and heartbroken poems will flow out of you for weeks to come, let it all happen. You’ll always be thankful for that little infinity. Grieve for what you’re bound to lose, but don’t run after him. He won’t come back. Let him go.<br>And every time you push away the girl with the inked hands and the bitten nails, she will come back. Let her. She’ll shower you with words and songs and hugs and forehead kisses and you’ll love her for it. She will hold you together when no other would be able to. Let her in.<br>College is everything you’d imagined it would be and more. I’m practically in love with the people whose orbits overlap with mine in this little universe that has just started to feel like home. I’m living a life you couldn’t even dream of, having experiences beyond your imagination. I’m so happy. Yes, the library sucks a little bit and there are no badminton courts here, but it’s worth it. I promise. You were right to look forward to it.<br>Though, I’m still not confident in my body. I still look at pictures of prettier people and cry a little bit. And no amount of trying has shaken me out of it. Maybe you could work on it a little bit for me, please?<br>Here’s some totally random advice: no matter how much people pressurise you to, don’t read any books unless you’re ready for them. Trust me, they’ll make much more sense later and you’ll end up appreciating them even more. Especially Chitra Banerjee. She will blow your mind.<br>One last thing: your hesitance to fully give yourself to someone, to truly fall in love, will strengthen with time. I’m still trying to unshackle myself from the fears and the loneliness it has brought upon me. I haven’t been very successful. Try to nip that little evil in the bud, before it blooms and ruins you and me.<br>It seems weird telling you these things. I mean, won’t it take the fun out of living and experiencing all this? But since I know you, for I am you, I know how much you love spoilers. So I’m giving you a few, hidden among what I feel are great words of wisdom. You better be grateful. Though, I still haven’t forgiven you for reading the summary of every episode of Game of Thrones before actually watching them. I mean, what were you thinking?!<br>Please stop being so weird. Just kidding, I love you.<br>Yours forever (against my will),<br>your 18 year-old self<br></p>
