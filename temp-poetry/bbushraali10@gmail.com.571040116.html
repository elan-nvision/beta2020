<p>Nostalgia: something I remember when I was inside my mother's womb. Noices, pain still echoes in my ears, because I turned out to be a girl preparing to come into this world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>BIRTH OF ANOTHER GIRL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Tears roll down my cheeks when ever I think of the maltreatment given to my mother when her husband (my father) came to know about my existence in her womb.</p>
<p>I wasn't there to witness such inhumanity she went through,</p>
<p>But my ears were developed.</p>
<p>I could here her heart beating fast as it was connected to mine,</p>
<p>I could here she begging my father to give me chance to live,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could feel the scars given to her every day and night.</p>
<p>I didn't see her body turning blue to purple, but I could feel her muscles bleeding and kicks given to her womb.</p>
<p>There were days when she wasn't given food to eat&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Just a reminder, I wasn't there to witness stuff but I could feel her)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were days when she wasn't given food to eat and water to drink,</p>
<p>But yet, she survived.To make me survive.</p>
<p>As the days passing by I realised it's time for me to come out and witness the abusive behaviour again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But there came a moment when everything felt little different</p>
<p>My mind was distributed and travelled through varied forms of fear.</p>
<p>My instantly, a gentle touch absorbed all my uneasiness and made me open my eyes wide, for that I knew it the only person who could make me feel that was would be my mother&nbsp;</p>
<p>But she was petrified, her eyes moving back and forth from our bed till the main door</p>
<p>Her lips were dried as if she was thirsty for love and affection.</p>
<p>Her trembling hands holding me close to her chest, assuring me that she'll never let me go.</p>
<p>But all of that disappeared when her eyes met mine, she gazed upon me with a smile with full joy and happiness as if it was a hustle journey of my birth&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now I am 18 years old.</p>
<p>Stout,brave, enticing,exiquisite.</p>
<p>All by my mother's sacrifice</p>
<p>I can proudly say&nbsp;</p>
<p>I AM A GIRL OF MY MOTHER'S WORLD.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I grew up old I realised&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dad was just another man who was against this sentence</p>
<p></p>
<p>BIRTH OF ANOTHER GIRL.</p>
