<p>Our thoughts may have quarelled, for thoughts are derived from the environment, from what each day brings to us. Thoughts have no place in the story of the heart and soul. It does not hold the power to speak of love nor to weigh it with terms of logic. It's the spiritual affinity that we share that binds us together. It is unfathomable and immeasurable. Our heart and soul have never quaralled because spiritually we are one and the same. Yours is a heart that burns but never melts and I wished to be your fire.&nbsp;</p>
