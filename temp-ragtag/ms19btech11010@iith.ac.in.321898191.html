<p>&nbsp;Swami was a coward , school going boy whose father puts him to adventurous tasks always. Once, his father read him the news of a boy applauded for saving the lives of farmers by fighting a tiger. Unluckily , Swami was ordered to sleep alone in the office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reluctantly, he had to prove. Thoughts of <em>untold mysteries</em> of villagers death from the tree preoccupied Swami’s mind. As he was about to sleep , he woke up on seeing a distinct shadow from the window . He ran into his Grandma’s lap.<br><em>Father stared from the corner.</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em><ins>The rest's disgrace!   </ins></em></p>
