<p>- A CLEARED QUEST-<br><br>I flew across oceans to meet<br><br>To meet my world,pleasant as it could be, decorated so well...it shines!<br><br>Like the planets and stars above the trees.<br><br>I can glide through the branches of my dreams.<br><br>So happy that you found my isolated tower in search of me.<br><br>As we knew in every way we were just destined to meet.</p>
