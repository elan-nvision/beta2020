<p>Hey buddy you are such  an amazing soul,till now everything is your way but from now you know things are going to take a turn.</p>
<p>Dont take pressure darling,dont think much really nothing matters at all,these marks,ranks everything is going to be just a number on a piece of paper..</p>
<p>Buddy think while taking a decision,who knows if you make a wise decision it would save you from dropping a year,it would save you from dropping from three universities,it would save you from those long hours trains,flights...</p>
<p>Buddy learn how to survive in those long journeys, travelling alone..have a good playlist..</p>
<p>Try to know how to control tears..nd know how to cry with tears as you loose all the tears in the future...</p>
<p>Try to know how to convince your parents to allow you to destroy your career,try to know how to stop their tears as you cause them to cry for days and weeks...</p>
<p>Buddy believe me you are going to go through hell,bear it... cry like hell,wander,travel...learn,have fun, nd after this hell you are going to get into a college where this hell is going to repeat again...</p>
<p>Who knows are you  going to top your exam,who knows are you going to be selected for HCU..</p>
