<p>She said "Listen to the scientists."</p>
<p>As Greta Thunberg-ish as it may sound, how dare we? Rampant usage of fossil fuels, merciless deforestation and unsustainable agriculture tagged<br>under the badge of assurance for increasing productivity to feed the ever growing population – not only contributing to climate change but also posing a threat towards sustainable survival of the population with access to nutritious food, clean water and safe air; and yet we choose to ignore. How dare we? With 42% of the world population being under the age of 25, the world population can be defined Young and here, India tops the list. Youth – who is utterly conscious of health and highly concerned about a low-carbon and climate resilient future – the definition of a bright tomorrow for us has been veiled by relentless destruction of our delicate environment. Are we doing anything towards it? May be. But is it being able to making a difference? An undisputed NO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Climate Strike being named the 2019 word of the year by Collins Dictionary following extensive preaching by the young Swedish Climate Change Activist as well as millions of other people, we cannot ignore the gravity of the given situation. The Tomorrow that the world is looking forward to is, in fact the red carpet for a destructive future which we ourselves have prepared. With Climate Crisis accelerating faster than most scientists expected, threatening natural ecosystems and fate of humanity – scientists have warned of ‘untold suffering’ and the only way we tackle that is by changing the way we live – controlling incessant population growth, leaving fossil fuels in ground with deforestation ceased.  Are we willing to? Yet a question that has a different answer from different mouths. It’s not just carbon emissions that deserve a hue-cy, it’s our attitude for change as well. It’s not just the surface temperature that needs to be lowered, it’s our excessive dependence on the ailing environment too that needs to be reduced in order to have a tomorrow where we can breathe without inhaling toxins.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While increasing the GDP growth remains a concern for every economy currently realizing the lipstick effect or those clutched in trade wars, we<br>aren’t realizing that it does no good to the green covers that are being sacrificed for the same, although a healthy ecosystem promises far better human well-being than business ever will. With the scientists having fulfilled their moral obligation of warning us about a dubious future, it is time we stop complaining about politics, governments, researchers and activists, rather switch to a bicycle to work today, or eat those drying fruits on dinner table. This is how it transforms – anticipating changes to living them. It cannot be denied that the world still remains gravely unprepared for effects of this climate apartheid and it would require either a trillion-dollar investment to avert it or aggregated individual efforts from each section of population.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the direction in which our planet’s health is headed<span style="color: rgb(95,91,91);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;font-family: Work Sans", Arial, sans-serif;">,</span> is definitely certain from the alarm that is raised every other day by smoggy dawns and<br>melting ice-bergs. The tomorrow we want to live in is definitely our responsibility. Youth, while they can efficiently put the alarm off, the<br>outcome is ensured when everyone joins hands for the greater good of environment and ensuring a future where no teenager ever skips her classes to educate us on the same.</p>
