<p>BREAK FREE</p>
<p>I wanna break free,</p>
<p>Out of this mess,</p>
<p>Out of everything I have ever been caught up in,</p>
<p>I wanna break free.</p>
<p>The sun’s sinking fast and there’s just one thing I know,</p>
<p>Smashing the chains and starting all over tomorrow,</p>
<p>Held up for so long, I wanna get out of here,</p>
<p>Fly away somewhere far,</p>
<p>That’s what I have always wanted to do,</p>
<p>Its always bothered me but,</p>
<p>Should I break free?</p>
<p>(Now read it bottom up.)&nbsp;</p>
