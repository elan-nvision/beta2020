<h3>In the arms of oblivion</h3>
<p>Standing in the delicate shimmer&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the moon, peeking through the clouds</p>
<p>Her hands around a wilting bouquet</p>
<p>Roses waiting to embrace the ground</p>
<p></p>
<p>Neath boughs old and graven</p>
<p>Cold stone slab erect</p>
<p>A symbol of bereavement</p>
<p>The kiss of time left derelict</p>
<p></p>
<p>There hidden within a wooden casket</p>
<p>Years of joy, stolen away</p>
<p>Promises left harrowingly hollow</p>
<p>In their repose they stay</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tears grace her pale cheeks</p>
<p>As she stand precariously at the edge</p>
<p>Of a sea of melancholy, beckoning her gently</p>
<p>To fall deep into it's frigid pledge</p>
<p></p>
<p>And again the night reaches</p>
<p>To take her hand</p>
<p>Guide her to her beloved</p>
<p>Past the shifting sands</p>
<p></p>
<p>Be rid of these seething embers,</p>
<p>That crawl towards her heart</p>
<p>Unwrap these drapes of solitude,</p>
<p>From it's cold caress, depart</p>
<p></p>
<p>And breaking the dusk's silence</p>
<p>The winds weep their dirge</p>
<p>For the tragedy lying upon that dirt</p>
<p>Maybe in heaven their souls will merge</p>
