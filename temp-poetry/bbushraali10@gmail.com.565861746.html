<p>Suffering : with intense suffering comes a point where you want to heal. But healing is a big process. Bigger than the world anticipates. My poem is about a girl that now chooses to heal, heal from all the pain caused by people. Because to heal she has to bare the pain. She's stitching her sorrows and sewing her secrets. Who's going to witness it? Mirror. Swim too deep to know her progress. Tittle is Seven stitches. //Seven stitches//<br><br>I'm sorry that I woke you up dear mirror,<br><br>I'm sorry that I do not have nice dress on, and makeup on my face,<br><br>I'm sorry because today you're going to witness something you might not like,<br><br>Something which you've never seen.<br><br>But dear mirror,<br><br>Hold on to me, please be gentle,<br><br>I'm going to undress myself.<br><br>Button by button,<br><br>Inch by inch,<br><br>You're witnessing the flesh that my body still holds,<br><br>The flesh which was torn apart,<br><br>The flesh that now fails to bleed,<br><br>Dried veins and arteries is all you gonna see, just like dried leaves on a breathing tree.<br><br>But dear mirror, please do not scream,<br><br>Please be humble <br><br>And  please do not rumble,<br><br>I am stiching my flesh, I'm joining my tissues,<br><br>I'm stiching a sweater which was torned someday.<br><br>I have to shut the mouth of the open scar,<br><br>I have to sew the secrets.<br><br>I'm taking a needle and a thread, <br><br>Stiching my sorrows and the past I've known that still exists in my head.<br><br>I've passed the thread through the needle, just like I'm going to pass it through my dried flesh.<br><br>The thread followed the path of the needle,<br><br>In and out, again and again,<br><br>Till it reached the end of my skin, and the pull so harsh and so tight.<br><br>Seven stitches felt like seven deaths, <br><br>Seven drill felt like seven different needless  pricked into my skin all at ones.<br><br>I've stitched it all, closed the screaming mouth,<br><br>Seven stitches were seven different flowers I've known before, smelled before and plucked them to plant it again inside my house,<br><br>The blemishes they had that was known,<br><br>But slowly as they dried, they poisoned my house,<br><br>They poisoned my body.<br><br>But left their petals inside.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>Blood on my fingers and faith in my palm,<br><br>The scream is the pain and loudness is the courage.<br><br>Seven little stitches, seven different reasons.<br><br>Sorry that I woke you up dear mirror,<br><br>This is all you've seen, this is something that you know now.<br><br>.<br><br>Nodded the mirror, smilled my reflection as if it could if I would.</p>
