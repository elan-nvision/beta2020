<p>Dear me:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dated for:<br>April 2023, on the day of graduation&nbsp;</p>
<p>To&nbsp;</p>
<p>My<br>22-year-old&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear me,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello, I hope you are doing good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From where should I start, first remember one thing I LOVE YOU no matter what you do and<br>where you end up. You are always good enough. Never regret the choices you<br>make.do not cry on your mistakes, we are humans after all we tend to make a lot<br>of mistakes. Learn to be happy with yourself.do things which make you feel<br>euphoric, even if it is big or small. Grasp every opportunity that comes your<br>way, that make you happy so that you wont regret of not taking it up later.<br>Enjoy little things in life. don’t set long time goals, it’s okay to not to<br>have a goal as long as you are happy, the world will automatically recognize<br>you. You can give up on anything in life when you feel exhausted but don’t give<br>up on yourself. Remember this past me is always rooting for you and I will<br>always believe you and the choices you make. Be independent and don’t let your<br>decisions be influenced by others be it your mom, dad, sister or anyone u love.<br>You can be yourself and people still will find a problem with it. So just be<br>yourself even more. Irritate their demon’s girl! Whenever you feel low, when<br>you that the world is against you, when you feel that you are walking on a road<br>alone without any destination, stop for sometime and read this letter. You are<br>strength to yourself, don’t doubt yourself even for one moment in life. I trust<br>you. And don’t forget to travel around the world clicking millions of selfies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s get it girl&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours lovingly&nbsp;</p>
<p>Past self&nbsp;</p>
