<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YOU ARE MY DESTINEY!</p>
<p>Making this happen was far away from my thought ,</p>
<p>Like a gift in my life , by my dad you were brought  ,</p>
<p>When heard about you , your  name , i can't even think like this   my heart would seize ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started feeling you in that every breeze ,</p>
<p>Every moment  to you , my praise !</p>
<p>Never thought , to me ,it would be this much craze ,</p>
<p>Not just a second it took , for those feelings of mine for you , to raise ,</p>
<p>Gave you in my life ,such a place that made you irresist togive me in your life , the same space ,</p>
<p>Nor I , you neither have thought that our relation would rum off ,this race,</p>
<p>Your are so understanding to me that , I am in depth understanding to you ,</p>
<p>Can't wait for that day , when we , togather and say , "yes!" , now we are completely together ,</p>
<p>Once we guys are one , get departed never , I wish whole heartedly and you as well , I hope that we live together for ever and ever .</p>
