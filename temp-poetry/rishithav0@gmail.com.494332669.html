<p>Change</p>
<p>Heavy footsteps, Crashing doors<br><br>From across the broken home<br><br>Breath held<br><br>Is this the man I know?<br><br>Nights filled with dread<br><br>Toes curled in<br><br>Nails to palm, moon like bruises along my skin<br><br>And then he barges in<br><br>This man. This strange man<br><br>In his drunken stupor <br><br>He dances with gravity <br><br>Belt unbuckled <br><br>Think about the marks it will leave<br><br>And like every night<br><br>He is not the man I know<br><br>Hand raised, leather shall come down<br><br>A rain of pain shall follow<br><br>But the night brings change you see<br><br>And tonight it had come over me<br><br>Tonight I hear sirens in the far<br><br></p>
