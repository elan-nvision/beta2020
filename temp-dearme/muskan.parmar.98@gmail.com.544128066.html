<p>Dear Muskan,</p>
<p>It's been a long time since we had a talk and I missed you all along. Yes, I am still to forgive you for those rash and blind decisions of yours, but am happy that you are healing fast. You understand relationships much better than before!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The life could have been something else if you wouldn't have explored those dark sides , which were probably the outcome of your endless fairytale dreams. The concept of love had been ever soo complicated one, people who feel righteous at the first look turn out completely wrong at the finish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May be you craved for some time and some care, and misunderstood it for love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Love , exasperating yet exhilarating , when its in its most truest form its serene, peaceful and absolutely quiet. An adventure in itself, needfull of no external excites</p>
<p>Wants reach end, beats reach high. Energies summit while eyes lock.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hope it never adds to your failed list of relations. May it reach pinacles you never felt before. And you have all your integrity to give it the best of you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And no matter what am always your there by your side.</p>
<p>Your little guiding light.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
