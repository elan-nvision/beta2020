<p>I am afraid;</p>
<p>I am afraid that those eyes won't ever look at me with the love that I pour into them;</p>
<p>I am afraid to even steal a glance at those beautiful black pools for lest I glimpse the stranger that they see;</p>
<p>I am afraid that in that seeing right through me they readily reveal my insubstantiality;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And cut off, therefore, the false things to which I've rooted myself,</p>
<p>And cast me into a Void,</p>
<p>Into a fall that never breaks...</p>
