<p>You looked beautiful when I first saw you,</p>
<p>and my heart just took me to another land.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was running in circles on top of the snow,</p>
<p>but it wasn't cold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember, we talked till late at night,</p>
<p>and none of us really wanted to leave.</p>
<p>But the magic happened when you passed me your hand,</p>
<p>we danced under the stars, and I remember you smiling.</p>
<p>For a sudden moment, everything else faded.</p>
<p>All I hear was music, and all I could see was,</p>
<p>us trying to follow each other's steps.</p>
<p>Yes, you almost tripped while doing the turn,</p>
<p>and we did laugh about it too.</p>
<p>All I remember now is how I felt about it&nbsp;</p>
<p>when<span style="font-size: 1.125rem;"> I looked at you. </span></p>
