<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">It wasn't slow, like the transition of seasons. Hell no. It hit me like a goddamn hurricane and tilted my world right on its axis. Because suddenly, you were all I thought of. Your jokes, your silly pickup-lines, your songs. You were the only person I loved to be around and the only one I was willing to sacrifice my sleep for. What we had was unexpected, but it was one of the best things to ever happen to me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">It was the little things at first. How you'd laugh and grin back at me when I flashed my teeth at you from across the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">How you'd sulk when I told you your taste in music was bad. How you'd smile when I got way too excited over food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">How you’d tell me everything about your day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">How you’d make me think that we had a chance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">I got used to you. And I didn’t even realise it until you'd wormed your way into my mind and taken possession of my every thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">I had no idea how we were always so comfortable with each other, so attuned to what the other was feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">How we could talk about anything and everything, from morning to night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">How you took me along as you went around the world, making me forget that you were four thousand miles away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">How it was okay to feel as if I'd known you forever and would continue to know you through eternity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">How, for a time, you loved me as I loved you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">I didn't fall in love with you, I barely knew you. But I did fall in love with the moments that you and I had. The way you would hold my hand just a little bit longer after a handshake. The way you gave me shit when I was being stupid. The way you mock-glared at me when I pulled your leg. The way you told me take care of myself because you weren't here to do it. The way you scolded me sometimes. The way you called my shirt 'cute' while we were walking down the stairs. The way you defended me. The way you shook your head when I stuck my tongue at you. The way you shyly brushed away my compliments. The way neither of us pulled away when our knees touched while you sat across from me. It all felt so warm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">It felt like home. You felt like home.</span></p>
