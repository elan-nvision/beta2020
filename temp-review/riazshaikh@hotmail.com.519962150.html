<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12pt;font-family: Calibri;">I don’t know how I got around to reading Juliet Johnston. And that too, a title like ‘Hero of Lesser Causes’. Maybe she is big on the Young adult fiction scene, especially among girls. What am I doing on that scene? A middle-aged Indian man, and that too not an English major or a teacher or a book reviewer; but a computers-management type to boot. I can’t figure it out. Maybe you can. Let me begin at the beginning. I picked up a tattered second-hand copy of her ‘Hero of Lesser Causes’ for my 10 year old daughter to read. And as I skimmed the pages to vet it for her, something happened. I got stuck into the story. By the time I finished, my daughter was rolling her eyes at my daily allusions to the book in general and ‘symbolic’ in particular.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12pt;font-family: Calibri;">I almost hate telling you the plot, because I want you to read it. Read it with an open, fresh mind. The story of Keely and her brother Patrick, against the backdrop of post-WW2 small town America. Quixotic Kelly is the hero of her imagination on her white charger, who suddenly faces an enemy that cannot be vanquished. Patrick is paralyzed by polio, but it is his mind that gets more disabled than his body. His negativity threatens Keely’s sympathy and joi-de-vivre, but she keeps fighting it. Nurse Peggy is warm and capable, but quite credibly sketched with her intolerance for Patrick’s swearing. Keely continues to try and help Patrick interact with the world and lead a real life. However, Patrick hits rock bottom and attempts suicide, but realizes the value of life and starts recovering. Keely continues to engross the reader with her heroism and frail humanity by turns.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12pt;font-family: Calibri;">The characters are wonderfully conceived and fleshed out. Real humans, warts and all, yet heroic in their own way. A balance between the idiosyncrasy and credibility makes the characters really interesting, yet believable. The plot is well-crafted too, but there is not too much reliance on the plot, and it is the characters and their everyday lives in extraordinary circumstances that take centre stage. The most impressive feature though is the period setting, and how the story never felt dated  despite the unfamiliar environment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 12pt;font-family: Calibri;">I felt this urge to communicate with this author who touched me with her well-told story, but would this ancient lady who wrote of her childhood in the pre-war era still be alive so many decades later? A little bit of internet research revealed her to be hale and hearty and alive and kicking! So how did she create that realistic milieu of an era that long before her? Okay, so she was a great researcher in addition to being a great writer. Actually, may be she was not a great writer; just somebody who managed to strike a chord in me. It is not like anybody else thought that was a great book. Oh wait, this book won an award! Yeah, like an award means anything. I mean, Citizen Kane got an Oscar for original screenplay and Titanic for best movie. Perhaps, the real award is the unreserved adulation of a man twice the age of the typical reader, from halfway across the world. Thank you, Mrs Johnston, for making reading enjoyable and meaningful again.</span></p>
