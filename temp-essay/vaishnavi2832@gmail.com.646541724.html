<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past decade</blockquote>
<p>10 years ago... The world was completely different place .. those were the days when we had to go to the cafe to use internet and sms and calls were really costly and  Memorise many numbers and if you wanted to see someone you had to travel to their place .human relations were valued and outdoor games were given a priority ..</p>
<p>As time changed technology evolved and right now all u want is a t your fingertips ... This evolution has its advantages as well as disadvantages too .. .. people are now addicted to their mobiles and stopped socialising with others ..gone are the days where children play on the streets and in open places and socialise ..these days children are given PlayStations etc which is a evolution of technology .</p>
<p>These days people have thousands on friends on social accounts but no real friends in life ... And always feel lonely mobiles a re a big addiction ... More like a drug........&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since all the calls and data became very affordable to the common man ... Everyone could afford it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This technology is also a boon cause complete treatment to some of the diseases was found.</p>
<p>Technology is a boon only as far as u make it a slave and if you become it's slave it becomes a bane ....&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us take an example: if u have a knife ... If used to cut vegetables proves to be helpful .. but the same knife in the hands of someone who is planning a suicide is fatal . So technology is compared to knife here if you use it in a good way it proves to be helpful ... But if I make technology use you it's fatal .... It's not that technology is ruling is we are actually letting it do so .&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conclusion is that technology is useful and well as harmful but that depends on the person using it ..</p>
