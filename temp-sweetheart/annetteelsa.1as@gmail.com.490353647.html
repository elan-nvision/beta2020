<p>I was there by your side, when the soft winter showers poured and you silently worked away,</p>
<p>Was there by your side when she left and you cried for days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've silently walked by your side, when your mood was down or high.</p>
<p>And as you proceed to move onward and hold another's hand, I'll still be there by your side, incase you need someone to lean back on, incase God forbid, things don't go right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as you proceed to test love with another, I promise you, I will be there by your side, waiting.&nbsp;</p>
