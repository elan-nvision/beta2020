<p>Frankly speaking, our country holds people who gets emotional and trusts others easily. May be it’s inherited by those daily serials that people watch . If not , how come we’re providing accommodations to those dangerous terrorists unknowingly in a lavish way ? How a man who didn’t even pass 10th std easily got certificated of doing masters in zoology ? STRANGE!  While dengue fever is prevailing nowadays , growth of serial fever is at higher rate than that ! People never miss an episode, those slow motion dramas and tedious ads !</p>
