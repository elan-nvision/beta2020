<p>You know that feeling? The one that you feel in the deepest depths of your stomach, where you feel like the steps you are taking are about to lead you to something spectacular but you don’t know what it is yet, where you feel like you can finally look at your present and be happy with it, and where when you are alone, with nothing and no one to trouble you, one person consumes your mind in a whole and you can’t do anything to stop it. Well, for me, that one person is you.</p>
<p>I want to be clichéd and say that you came into my life so suddenly and without even letting me know, created this mess which slowly is starting to look beautiful. I want to be clichéd and say that I didn’t realize you swept me off my feet till I didn’t feel the ground beneath me and all that was there were your arms holding me up. I want to be clichéd and say that it was three in the morning and all I could think about was the smile you gave me when I hadn’t spoken any words.</p>
<p>The thing is, love didn’t make me blind. It was the opposite. I was blind not to notice the love. But, everything looked more clear after I finally realized. I kept running from it, probably knowing just how hard I would fall. I was scared, scared of so many things at once.</p>
<p>My past hasn’t been a garden of flowers for sure and has left me wounded and vulnerable. You became an important person in my life that I was afraid to lose you in any way and I kept my mind convinced that ignoring my feelings was the best for us. But when you held my hand and brushed the hair away from my face, explaining how stupid my decisions have been, all I could think about was how good my hand felt in yours. It was at this moment that my heart slapped my mind back to its senses and made me look at what I was trying to do.</p>
<p>It is no secret that I am a hard person to deal with. Yet you did not give up. And here we are, every bad decision in our lives leading up to this inevitable chapter.  If all the pain I went through was to lead me to you, I won’t hesitate for even a second to do it all again.</p>
<p>My past has taught me that no matter how perfect the future seems in all it's aspects, things can always turn out to be something you never expect. But, God, do I pray no matter how my life turns out to be, you remain my future. Because, when it comes to you, I like me better. When it comes to you, I feel happy.</p>
