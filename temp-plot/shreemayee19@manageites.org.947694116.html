<p><strong><ins>LOST LOVE</ins></strong></p>
<p>The bedsheet looks near new, few creases yet have made way,</p>
<p>Oh but I have always been this messy, a little more may be,</p>
<p>But you see I have learned to neaten them overtime.</p>
<p>I no more sleep on crumpled sheets.</p>
<p>There have been sleepless nights, I agree,</p>
<p>With almost every alternate day, the reason being lurid,</p>
<p>You expected your eyes?</p>
<p>I often reimagine my nightmares the following night,</p>
<p>So that I don’t dream of you again.</p>
<p>Yet I yell every time I dream of you-</p>
<p>On the other side of bed-</p>
<p>Staring at me, smiling, cringing at me snoring, yet,</p>
<p>Smiling.</p>
<p>I would sit up with the dampness soaking my cheeks,</p>
<p>Turning them into a rich shade of red, exactly the way you liked.</p>
<p>So I splatter my face with another round of tears,</p>
<p>Smoldering them, smothering them, my fears.</p>
<p>And neaten up the sheets another time,</p>
<p>To assure my heart you couldn’t be there, again, this time.</p>
<p>To assure my heart you couldn’t be there, again, this time.</p>
<p>You see, I made sure no one found your corpse in that ditch,</p>
<p>Wrapped in the old sheets, you said, kept you warm on nights like this.</p>
<p>Oh but I have always been this messy, a little more may be,</p>
<p>Last night they found you, your face cringing in sleep.</p>
<p>I wonder if they buried you right,</p>
<p>For creaseless sheets disturbed your slumber,</p>
<p>And I prefer you sound asleep.</p>
