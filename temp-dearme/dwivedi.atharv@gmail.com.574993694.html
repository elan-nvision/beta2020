<p>Addressed to:  My 15- year old self (I am 21 now )&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dear Me</strong>,</p>
<p>I don’t know how uncanny it must feel to be receiving a letter from your Future self, but on the bright side, at least you know that technology has made those leaps which Asimov often talked about, eh? You remember Isaac, right? We used to read his works a lot when we were kids. God, it is so strange to use “we” right now! Nonetheless, I know what you’re thinking. What do I mean by used to, right? Well that’s exactly what this letter is about, old sport.</p>
<p>I cannot reveal your near future, as I’m not allowed to do so. You see, there is this bitch who goes by the name of Time Paradox. She will really screw us both up if I try to alter our destiny. What I can do, though, is drop a few hints which can only be picked up by me (or you, in this case :P). So let’s see how you run that 10 CGPA worth brain of yours. That made us happy, right? High school was a rollercoaster of bittersweet memories and self-absorbed fun. Now it’s your moment to choose. Choose a line of study, choose the group of friends you will bid farewell to, choose your path, as our society liked to put it. Let your older (and more damaged) self tell you, that they are wrong, not surprisingly. It is not that big of a choice. Whatever you decide to do, you will always have the window to pursue what you really want and repeatedly change the course of your destiny. What really matters are the smaller decisions you make while pursuing this chosen path. If there’s one thing that I can tell you, it is that happiness is underrated. Your calculative but naïve brain is full of ambitions and aspirations, I know. But you’re in for a rude awakening, kid. Choose the journey, rather than the destination, because I didn’t. While chasing the golden egg, I may have brought a lifetime of baggage upon myself. Be it the undying love for literature that you have, or that seed of political and socio-economic debates that the news has just sown into you, or the habit of running that Dad instilled in us, don’t let them slide. Or let them, I’m no one to preach. But what you want, can be achieved with all of those things too! This notion of necessary sacrifice that our peers show us just before stepping into the game, is nothing but an illusory bait. An excuse to feel good about ourselves years later, while suffocating the spirit inside of us. After all, you have your whole life to be a stoic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Why is he talking like a freeing Grim Reaper? Do I turn out to be a vegetable after a couple of years or what?", you must be wondering. A valid doubt too, if I may say so. What all I have talked about yet, may come across as morose. It's just that I don’t want to waste this opportunity to express my experience to you, however vague the description might appear to you. The years to come are uncharted territory for you. I just want to emphasize the thrill that you ought to seek while battling those waters. Not everything would be a win-lose situation though. There’s much to look forward to, kiddo. You will have a bunch of misadventures, develop the closest bonds of your life, fall in love (a couple of times, yeah). You will have your heart squeezed and broken into shards, each time losing a part of yourself but gaining an important lesson. You will make mistakes, repeat them like a fool, and keep making them till Mom smacks some sense into you.</p>
<p>Regardless of what path you take or choices you make, know that you will make it. You will come out stronger after each setback, an unconquerable soul, if I may quote ‘Invictus’. Yeah. Our soft corner for clichés will never vanish. I believe in you, old sport. And mathematically, if I believe in you, you ought to believe in yourself (I think Ramanujan just threw up in heaven). That’s all I’m allowed to say, I believe. And no, I’m not going to tell you how we lost our virginity! (did we though? xD)</p>
<p>Say Hi to Mom and Dad. Tell Mom to take care of her hair. Spend more time with the nutcase our brother is. :) Lastly, strive to be better than only one guy in this world. <strong>Me</strong>.</p>
<p>Yours Truly,</p>
<p>Much hotter self.</p>
