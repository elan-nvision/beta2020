<p>&nbsp;As soon as I came to the house from a long day of tedious work in school loaded with lots of homework, yelled “Amma open the door “. My mom who was busy in her favourite T.V. show , reluctantly opened the door to let me in. as I was about to step in , she ordered me to wash my foot before entering how tired I was with drooping eyes? Do washing really matter in that case?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to obey. My favourite cartoons timings were nearing and my mom infront of T.V. was watching Naagin . how worse the situation  of me would be if I politely ask “ Amma , will you please stop watching Naagin and lend me that remote so that I can watch my favourite show Doraemon? I surely guess she would give me two options- a slap or else an emotional shame on me watching cartoons so that I would never ask that question again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better to leave off the room until all those things happen , I thought. But mother was viewing from long ago serial after serial one by one. Then I thought of a very nice idea, I thought myself intellectual for that. Whenever my mother went into the kitchen to cook , I would be changing the channel , I thought. But my mother was more intellectual than me. She correctly went into the kitchen with timing to cook part-by-part and as soon as the ads end, she was back again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glad , I missed it again. I would never be getting a chance to watch my shows until my mother’s done with watching the T.V. So I left for good, to do my homework. So concentrating, I did it all in one go with an idea to watch any show that’s left for me at that timing. Soon, my mother’s watch-list of serials ended up for that day and I was in much excitement . As soon as I switched on the T.V., a screaming voice at me was heard. “It’s time to go to bed” she said. I surely had those two options again. But I couldn’t dare to reject her. It might be for my betterment. That day, I slept without watching my shows with a grief stricken, heavy heart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I consoled myself for unable to see them. Mother also had her entertainment in her shows. She was always busy in handling the things along with me How could I reject her order?  She worked hard that day than that of me. Surely she’s the one who’s in need of T.V. the most, I believed. Next day, as it was Sunday, my mother had let me watch until the midnight. Waiting always pays off !!! She recognized my intentions , I thought. She’s the one who always knows me better than anyone else. Her love never diminishes. Misunderstandings come and go . They exist only for a moment.&nbsp;</p>
