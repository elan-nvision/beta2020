<p>To: My 15 year old insipid self</p>
<p>Dear me,</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I profoundly remember waking up to the tap of rain drops as they embraced the soil bringing up an earthly aroma. I’m pretty sure you would be cuddled up in your bed with a warm cup of hot chocolate by your side as you read through this letter, I suppose? Consider it to be a piece of advice, or suggestion or maybe a pile of junk either. The best part of thriving in this world of ours itself is the sheer unpredictability of life and</span> <span style="font-size: 16pt;">you would not want me to let the kitten out of the bag….but there’s a lot I have been thinking about lately and pouring out my heart would perhaps soothe my soul and help me find solace.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Don’t be that studious, nerdy guy at school. Have fun, break rules, laugh your heart out with friends. There’s still time. I miss those days and cherish the memories<br>and in fact sometimes , I am filled with regret and remorse for not living life to the fullest back in the school. Marks. That’s what you kept chasing all the while. Now I have become a bit mature and got a vivid picture and clarity that marks and grades don’t determine where you stand nor do they bring about happiness. Trust me when I say this. Break open from the barrier of rules and ‘obedience’ and venture out and explore your interests instead of being confined in the world of solving trigonometry or memorizing chronological order of the emperors of the Mughal empire. </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Life would throw rocks at you…challenges would keep coming. Have faith in yourself and muster up courage recollecting that ‘Dark Knight’ quote that always hits me hard. “The night is darkest just before the dawn”. But then, you would make great friends who would be by your side, extending their support during testing times. At the same time undeniably, there would the stock</span> <span style="font-size: 16pt;">who would change their colors contrary to your expectations which would eventually lead to questioning of your decisions. It is solely your call whether to stitch those worn garments again or to get a pair of new ones.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Keep introspecting yourself and also question your decisions. That is one of your best qualities- of feeling remorseful but getting back stronger at the end of<br>the day. You are a voracious reader, wildly imaginative and a pretty good artist but yet you are never aware of your capabilities and doubt yourself after every minute step that you take forward-try to fix that up as soon as possible. I know its a hard task to stay away from that slice of pizza or the mouth watering chocolates, but just refrain yourself from having excess of junk food and rest should be fine.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;">On a final note, always be grateful to mom and dad for restoring their trust in you, giving you the wings of freedom and never having the ‘bar of expectations’ that<br>our society has become synonymous with. </span> <span style="font-size: 16pt;">I’m sure you already have had enough of this and are mad at me for speaking up all the crap which from “your” perspective shouldn’t have been told about. Let me end this by driving you more mad.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;">P.S: Quit complaining about mom’s food and relish whatever she makes while you are at home. You will eventually understand what I am talking about.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
