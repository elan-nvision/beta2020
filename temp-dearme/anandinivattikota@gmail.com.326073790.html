<p>Dear Why-add-Elaichi-in-the-Biryani? ponderer me ,</p>
<p>Dated back : When I was just ten,like eight years back [15 September,2010]</p>
<p>To</p>
<p>My 10 year old,most bizarrely curious self</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dear unbaked self ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate your undercover petting of caterpillars in the Cadbury box.I know your curiosity is choking you to become a perfectionist and the urge to grow up pretty often dives you into imaginary world where your limbs are grown-sharp and sculpted,yet can’t fathom further as you are stuck on what’s the difference between inches and centimeters in height;if a plant is growing within you since the time you swallowed your favorite custard apple seed (oh yes,another doubt added to 'does this list even end?' list);when you can decode the mystery behind the blue ink splash in television ads;seek all the answers as a part of your immortal quest for cosmos,art,science,nature and life (spoiler:you’re gonna love politics as well) and make believe Mom,Bear Grylls has got zero influence on your pickiness of veggies. (don't worry honey,these muggles don't get you.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now hold on! I’m gonna tell you things which no one will tell you,love.Don’t stop bantering to maa and paa on how you made friends,how you honestly took pride for kicking sister,how your poop looked like duck and cloud like a dinosaur.Let it all out. Let your soul wild and free. You’ll soon know life is a lot better that way.Be unapologetic about your emotions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there’s a trick.”A still tongue makes a wise man”.Not all puzzles are meant to be solved. Not all questions need answers.Not everything needs reasoning and logic.Nonsense,makes sense. All won’t like you and take you as your Grandma does but it’s fine. Days come;Days go. People come;People go. You halt at places;some places halt at you. You’re a part of this gypsy wheel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’re gonna travel time from 9 3/4 to 9/11 and beyond. There are gonna be lot of elements diminishing your spark in terms of heartbreaks,failures and what they call REALITY!(Believe me,these muggles are jealous of your magic).But don’t ever dim or doubt your charm.Ride your own unicorn,paint your own rainbows and make your each chapter beautiful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m writing this letter to that ambitious little girl too. Be safe in the knowledge that you are growing towards the rings around rings they find when they finally dig you up.Thanks for being the light guiding me home,best friend. You rock!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unknowingly evolving each day,</p>
<p>To own the unknown.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yours lovingly,</p>
<p>Elaichi-is-the-essence-of-Biryani believer-Your future self&nbsp;</p>
