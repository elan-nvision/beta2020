<blockquote>&nbsp;SWEETHEART&nbsp;</blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I think Stephen Hawking is<br>true.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">“Time can be infinite.”</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The first time you walked<br>into the class, the first time our eyes met as we grazed into each other, the<br>first time we shared a smile, felt like the universe has paused for us to enjoy<br>the moment.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">It’s the moment I felt you’re<br>gonna be my SWEETHEART…</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Entire class thought it was<br>embarrassing for us to shout the same wrong answer in the class. Little did<br>they know that it’s gonna be one of my most memorable moments. Well, it’s bound<br>to happen, as our minds connected as well as our hearts.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I was on my nerve to ask you<br>out on a date. But when you said yes, the amount of adrenaline released in me<br>was…., infinite.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Every single minute , hour ,<br>day I spent with you, thinking what we could become, made me fall for you more.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The time, when we used to<br>walk on that empty night street, holding each other’s hands, talking nothing,<br>but still understand each other, is the time I knew I wanted this for the rest<br>of my life.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">But destiny had other plans.<br>Sure, it was hard when we wanted different things in life, as it gave a hint<br>that nothing lasts forever.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Now I look back and see<br>nothing but our matching footsteps leaving an impression of this incredible<br>journey, till we drifted apart.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Many might come and leave,<br>but I’ll always remember you as my first wondrous</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">SWEETHEART…..</span></p>
