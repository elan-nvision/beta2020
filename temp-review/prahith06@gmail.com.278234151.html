<p><span style="font-size: 24px;">The Dark Knight</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;">Intro:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Literally every single scene is a masterpiece. And the soundtrack adds some kind of special sauce to it. It's directed by my fav film maker,  Christopher Nolan. Though being a superhero movie, it's story and the acting by the cast will leave everyone awestruck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;">Summary:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">The story is about a physcopath who wants to destroy a city called Gotham. The physcopath is named JOKER. Meanwhile a watchful mercenary named BATMAN, the protecter of Gotham, tries to stop him with all his efforts by breaking a few rules. On the other hand, the district's new DA, Harvey Dent, is locking up all the criminals of Gotham following all the rules. The people of Gotham builds trust on Dent and admires him. District comissioner Jim Gordan helps Dent on his mission. Batman, Dent and Gordan team up to beat Joker as they realise that he is way out of their league. The Joker puts toxic into Dent's mind and transforms him into a physcopath, which results in a few deaths by Dent. This was Joker's plan. But Batman takes the blame of those deaths, as the truth would break people's trust on everyone and would destroy Gotham eventually. Doing this, he saved the people of Gotham even without them realising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;">Analysis:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">The Irony here is, a joker is suppossed to be humorous and a Bat to be scary. But in the movie it's opposite. And I'm afraid that the Joker has won. He broke down the best of 3 heroes of Gotham - Dent and turned him into a criminal. People of Gotham admired Dent. If it were not for Batman's sacrifice, Gotham would have been ashes by it's own people. I learnt when it's comes to greater good, we HAVE to go to any extent, even if we have our reputation and life at stake. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;">Conclusion:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">This 2008 masterpiece will always hold it's place as one of the best movies ever. This movie reflects present people's behaviour. Even the greatest can fall down to the deepest pits if they are pulled down. Because, MADNESS IS LIKE GRAVITY, ALL IT TAKES IS A LITTLE PUSH. </span></p>
