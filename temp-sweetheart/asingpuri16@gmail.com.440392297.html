<p>My love,&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I spent a big chunk of life believing in true love. Had a heartbreak or two in the way, but I always had the resolve to wait for that one person who would be mine. My friends don't usually see it the way I do, you know because I wasn't waiting for you. You just happened. When I decided to give you my all, I didn't think in the slightest that you would become mine forever. And yet you did.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But now, I have you. What next? Why do all stories end right here? How am I supposed to find out what I have to do, now that I have found love? You are somewhere building an army of skills that you will use to conquer the world, while on the other side of the world I am crawling towards a fascination I held since my childhood. But where do we go from here? Will our paths ever cross again, if we don't force them to do so? Even if we didn't have lofty personal ambitions, surely the fact that my grandfather was a farmer while yours was a trader would be enough to keep us apart.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lately, this dilemma has got me thinking about the entire institution of love as I saw it. I was so busy being a know-it-all that I never noticed my idea of love is in direct contrast with my agnosticism. And now that I do, I can't help but ask for a change.  I want to, as Kalindi from Lust Stories would put it, explore my sexuality. I want to explore other Gods. Don't get me wrong; you will always be my only and my best friend. But I wish to go out there and develop a crush and admire a God's work and feel what it is like to be touched and get my heart broken some more. Will you be a Mihir to my Kalindi?</p>
<p></p>
<p>I get it; I can live the usual way, that's what everyone would want, perhaps you too. Would it change the fact that I am always attracted to the outrageous? Had you been here, closer, my world would have started and ended with you. Did you really have to give me my soulmate so early that I would sit here wondering what to do with the rest of my life? You're not here, and that makes all the difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>All my life, I have only learnt that everything I wrote above is wrong, is a sin, until my heart told me otherwise. <span style="color: rgb(95,91,91);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 16px;font-family: Work Sans", Arial, sans-serif;">Perhaps getting acquainted with Franklin Veaux might have had a hand in it. </span> However, you have the power to decide what it really is, now. So tell me, love, what do you want?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Your love</p>
