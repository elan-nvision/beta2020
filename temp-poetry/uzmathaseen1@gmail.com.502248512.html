<p>Title -Mending my broken heart</p>
<p></p>
<p>It started with once upon a time,</p>
<p>When the beating of our hearts rhyme,</p>
<p>And I thought it will end with a happily ever after,</p>
<p>I just thought that we will grow old together,</p>
<p></p>
<p>All those times that we're together,</p>
<p>All those days that seems forever,</p>
<p>All those memories that we share,</p>
<p>Our past that I don't want to remember,</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt the pain and agony,</p>
<p>On the day that I set you free,</p>
<p>You said that your feelings fot me are gone,</p>
<p>So it's time for me to accept that we're done,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even if I tell myself that it's okay,</p>
<p>That I'll forget it all one day,</p>
<p>My heart is still broken,</p>
<p>From the fact that you're already taken,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now I'm trying to mend my broken heart,</p>
<p>Trying to put back all it's part,</p>
<p>I will try to move on,</p>
<p>Even if my heart still holds on.</p>
