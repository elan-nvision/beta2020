<p>&nbsp;For a new<br>beginning again&nbsp;</p>
<p>The universe<br>calls out again, again&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the storm<br>rose up to the sky&nbsp;</p>
<p>Darkness<br>suddenly stretched its legs&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dusty clouds<br>covered the heights and the land&nbsp;</p>
<p>The day became<br>dark like nights&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nights even<br>darker&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fear of the<br>turmoil of the nights&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surrounded all<br>people, all matter&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the warm<br>smile of the sun&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peaked from the<br>eastern sky again&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a new<br>beginning again&nbsp;</p>
<p>The universe<br>calls out again, again&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The storm was so<br>strong&nbsp;</p>
<p>It could make<br>huge mountains tremble&nbsp;</p>
<p>The storm was so<br>strong&nbsp;</p>
<p>It could uproot<br>trees&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh! What may<br>have happened to the shelter of twigs!&nbsp;</p>
<p>When rock<br>palaces shook&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tell me, the<br>bird of hope, where were you hiding?&nbsp;</p>
<p>That you went up<br>to the sky&nbsp;</p>
<p>Head held high<br>with pride again&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a new beginning<br>again&nbsp;</p>
<p>The universe<br>calls out again, again&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between the<br>canines of the biting sky&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dawn smiles&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sky screams,<br>the sky thunders&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the flight<br>of birds flies singing birdsongs for miles&nbsp;</p>
<p>See that bird<br>soaring with a twig in her beak&nbsp;</p>
<p>So easily, so pleasantly<br>she zooms past the winds of creek&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sorrow of<br>destruction can never surpass&nbsp;</p>
<p>The joys of<br>construction&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the<br>silence of apocalypse the creation sings again&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a new<br>beginning again <span style="font-size: 12pt;font-family: Times New Roman", serif;">The universe calls out again, again</span>&nbsp;</p>
