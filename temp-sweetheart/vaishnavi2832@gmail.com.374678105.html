<p>They say first love is very special and so is mine... It all started weirdly in a Cafe I went with my friend to meet her boyfriend and then alongside her boyfriend came another guy.. This guy wasn't so attractive but something about him made me think all night about him.. So the next day I badly wanted to see him again.. Dont know why but I felt that he is not like the other boys I met and his sense of humor was so good. Finally it took me a weeks time to get hold of his phone number.. And  After that I texted him and it really took all my guts to do that and hence we guys started talking.. Days passes and I wasn't able to stay a day without talking to him... Spending time with him made me forget all my worries and he isn't like all the males...... He shared all. His pass codes with me and always was transoerant about everything every thing seemed so fine. The so called 2 am talks were really nice.. There were days when we talked till 4:30 in the morning..and  I transformed from a girl who never believe anyone.. To the girl who is ready to keep my heart in his hands and there came the day when he proposed and that was the day right before his birthday. Every time I feel that he  everyone are Turing against me he was there for me.. All was good until four months and suddenly things started to change.. He had some problems for which he gave up on love and then forgetting him became a really big task.. His memories make me cry.. I miss the past we</p>
