<p><strong>Epitaph</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">What was that? Whatever it was.<br>It was normal, or at least, seemed so.<br>But now it's gone and I can't remember<br>When it was that it became something worth<br>Remembering and rejoicing and relishing.<br>But, only a memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">I was there. Not because you were there.<br>We were still there. Not for each other?<br>Yet we were there. Now, we're not.<br>But, it feels like we were for each other?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">I thought you would be. Though first I didn't.<br>Now, I see what the second one didn't.<br>The first one was right. You aren't there.<br>But the third one is strong. I am still there.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">The change was stark. A delta function.<br>But it is now gone. A mere flat turf now.<br>Seems like normal. Yet, it isn't. But, it is.<br>The autocorrelation function is still zero.<br>The system has lost the memory of its past.<br>The memory hasn't still left my system.<br>But you have.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">I feel clean, refreshed and satisfied. <br>Knowing I had regretted the loss of something that was not there.<br>It wasn't there. It hadn't felt so. So, it could not have been.<br>Now I just be.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: transparent;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial;">An epitaph? <br>An imagined tomb. <br>An empty casket.</span></p>
