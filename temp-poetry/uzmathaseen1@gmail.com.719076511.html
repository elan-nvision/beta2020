<p>Title -Be yourself</p>
<p>&nbsp;Be yourself,&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have one life to live,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compromise and adjust are good words,&nbsp;</p>
<p>But don't let yourself fade away in the mid process,&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are here to survive for others but most importantly for yourself,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Don't let the inner demons and the chronching voices of people affect you,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't die with regrets;</p>
<p>&nbsp;die with memories instead,&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have one life, Be yourself</p>
