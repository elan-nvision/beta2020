<p>Crimson Hues</p>
<p>A neo noir reel whizzes through my mind. All the characters in sync with each other. Not a sign of sinister shadows in sight. The children are playing in the backyard. The Great War of jellybeans still not over between Jenny and Kiara. An unfamiliar calmness flowing through my veins, still not sure about it's source though. Was it the embrace of a secure present or the chain of chortles that now echoes constantly in the house? As I wonder about this onset of merriment season, my gaze falls upon her.<br><br>Her. The eyes that sing the most serene tunes, the lips that weave magic into the air. Even after a decade or so, I still find myself in disbelief that I married a being who would change my life in the best of ways.<br><br>The four of us, pacing through one life but still living blissfully in one paused instance of time. <br>And in that exact moment, the reel slips through. As I see the moment flash away, smearing a red tinge across my psyche, I feel myself slipping away, far from the realms of REM and reality. <br><br>But the purpose is too strong. Demanding the strongest of wills. I catch the reel and put it away safely under the comfort of the sub-conscious. <br><br>The blade now dripping with her blood. I stare at the lifeless bodies of both of them, as they lie on our bed. An uncanny feeling of closure wrapping my inner self.<br><br>I drive back to the motel, where my two girls would be waiting. For their Dada to return. After all, they were too young to fathom the depth of a betrayal. I, on the other hand, had already mapped our fateful journey.<br><br><br></p>
