<p>My childhood dreams seem a satire</p>
<p>All my ambitions are on a smouldering fire</p>
<p>For all i must do is function&nbsp;</p>
<p>On others' desire</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gone are the days when i used to admire</p>
<p>The festivities or the traditional attire</p>
<p>For all i must do is function</p>
<p>On others' desire</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only thing in me is ire</p>
<p>The whole egocentric world is liar</p>
<p>But all i must do is function</p>
<p>On others' desire</p>
<p></p>
<p>And here i am stuck in a mire</p>
<p>The situation is getting even more dire</p>
<p>And all i must do is function</p>
<p>On others' desire</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
