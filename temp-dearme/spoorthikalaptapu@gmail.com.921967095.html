<p>My 14 year old, naive self</p>
<p>Hey Spu,</p>
<p>This is your eighteen year old self.... from the future!!!ðŸŽ‰ I know you are probably thinking that this is probably just a prank because you're very rational, sceptical, cynical and all that.ðŸ˜— But no. You're wrong this time hon. Turn out sh*t like this happens. Now don't go about trying to find some logical explanation as to how this is possible. I know you still don't think this is real but well.. I know you threw mom's phone in the water bucket in that summer vacation at granny's house. So yes. This is me for real.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, what I wan to tell you....Most importantly love, studies are not everything. Go out and talk to people and do fun stuff with kids your age.ðŸ‘«ðŸ’ƒ Try not to give too many fu#!s about every little thing. You need to take it easy. Everything's gonna be fine. And no we are not gonna end up below poverty line. I still don't know why I used to think that.ðŸ˜‚ Things are gonna be shitty every now and then but they'll pass. Bear with it. You're going to be just fine honey.ðŸ’ª Amma-Nanna may not tell you they love you or show visible signs of affection does'nt mean they don't love you or anything. They're dealing with sh#t of their own.  You are cooler than you think.ðŸ‘ŒðŸ’¯ Show off some of that cool-ness every now and then. Things are going to be just fine. You worry all too much. Believe in yourself hon.ðŸ˜‡ You got this. It doesn't pay to be an introvert in this extrovert dominated world ... but it has its perks. TRUST PEOPLE. Its important. Despite appaerance its important to have good freinds that you can always rely on. AND NO MOM AND DAD ARE NOT THE VILLAINS. Well they kinds of are, they are not very good at parenting we both know that but I guess they are doing their best. I'm not gonna give you any details of your future because you have to experience it all on your own. But here's one spoiler: you end up studying  the subject you want - PSYCHOLOGY!!!ðŸ™Œ Well that's all for now. Hard work always pays. Don't give up when sh@t gets hard. I know I sound like mom but well I gotta tell you what I gotta tell you. With love and best regards. Your future self. ðŸ¤—</p>
