<p>BLOOD</p>
<p>Its in the blood that  we share,</p>
<p>The blood I don’t care.</p>
<p>I am out. Nothing left in there,</p>
<p>Out of home and everywhere.</p>
<p><br>Homes away, but blood’s still in here,</p>
<p>The blood I would love to smear,</p>
<p>Through the walls of haunted pain,</p>
<p>Through the nightmares of sheer disdain.</p>
<p><br>I’m out. Far and away.</p>
<p>Far from home and arrant dismay.</p>
<p>The blood’s turning green, and I don’t care,</p>
<p>Shame on the blood you and I share.&nbsp;</p>
